## Content & Curriculum

[Data Science Curriculum](https://github.com/gocodeup/data-science-curriculum): Read the Readme. It will cover everything else that is not in here.

[Data Science Textbook](https://github.com/gocodeup/data-science-curriculum/tree/master/content)

[Markdown Handouts](https://github.com/gocodeup/data-science-curriculum#handouts): Instructions on generating handouts from markdown docs.

[DS_Classroom_Shared_Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B98OaM1j9BSefldTbC00SGdRbllTZUk4N1IwVmRHVWNycFZQeFhRTnp4Z2hSdGJqS2FCSlU?usp=sharing): When you are first added as an instuctor to a Google classroom, Google will create a folder in your Google Drive titled "Classroom". Within that folder, you will have a folder for each classroom you are added to (like Ada, Bayes, Curie, ...). These folders are your individual folders. The folder linked here, should be the classroom drive we all work out of. Creating documents within the DS_Classroom_Shared_Drive will ensure that all instructors, by default, have access to them, and that they are stored in the same structure as the other instructors. Within this folder are folders with various artifacts, such as data and handouts, organized by module. The idea is to keep all of these artifacts that are external to our textbook in a central place, not within each cohort classroom. We then can add shortcuts to these folders as we create a new cohort class. I'm sure there is a better solution for this that we can get to at some point, but for now, this will work!

[CSV Data for Student Access](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B98OaM1j9BSefldTbC00SGdRbllTZUk4N1IwVmRHVWNycFZQeFhRTnp4Z2hSdGJqS2FCSlU): This folder within the Classroom Shared Drive contains csv files used in lessons & exercises. Students should have access to view files in this folder.

To see the exercise repo for each cohort (where most lessons and many exercise reviews are pushed), visit the [CodeupClassroom repo](https://github.com/CodeupClassroom) and search for the cohort name.

[Data Skills 101](https://dataskills101.github.io/) is a resource for students & potential students. "This site houses a great set of resources for learning python basics and pandas intermediate skills. It can serve as a companion to your Python 101 Exercises in Kaggle and an introduction to interactive notebooks that allow you to write both text (markdown and html) and code in the same interactive environment. The key to learning to code is to code…consistently; it’s that simple. We’re excited to help you launch your journey!"
