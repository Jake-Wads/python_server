    "#### VCS/DVCS: (Distributed) Version Control System\n",
    "\n",
    "#### repository \n",
    "\n",
    "project managed with git, a folder and all the files/contents within that folder.  All respositories are folders but not all folders are repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git\n",
    "Version control system\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Github\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system, a place for us to store our repositories in the cloud.  A portfolio for anyone who writes code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "strength of the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a series of other changing, independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Variable Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "models the relationship between a single input independent variable (feature variable) and an output dependent variable using a linear model, i.e a line.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Variable Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "models the relationship between multiple independent input variables (feature variables) and an output dependent variable. The model remains linear in that the output is a linear combination of the input variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "models the non-linear relationship of the independent variables and the dependent variable. For example, the relationship could follow a sine, cosine, exponential, logrithmic, or quadratic function, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Stated another way, by Jason Brownlee https://machinelearningmastery.com/supervised-and-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms/\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that has been organized into a formatted repository, like a database, for more effective processing and analysis. A data structure is a kind of repository that organizes information for that purpose.\n",
    "https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/structured-data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Database Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database management system is a database management system based on the relational model of data. Most databases in widespread use today are based on this model.  It stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature/Independent Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable is what is being studied and measured in the experiment. It's what changes as a result of the changes to the independent variable. The values of dependent variables depend on the values of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sum of Squared Error\n",
    "\n",
    "a.k.a. the residual sum of squares, the sum of squared residuals.  It is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model. A small RSS indicates a tight fit of the model to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coefficient of Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "aka R-Squared, measures the fraction of the total variation in the dependent variable that is captured by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classifier\n",
    "An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification model\n",
    "series of steps that take the patterns of input variables, generalize those patterns, and apply to new data in order to predict the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature\n",
    "A feature, aka input/independent variable, is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Classification\n",
    "Classification with two possible outcomes. e.g. pass/fail\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi class classification\n",
    "Classification with more than two classes, where each sample is assigned to one and only one target label. e.g. Students' grade level in school (1st-12th) ### What are classification algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REPL: Read Evaluate Print Loop\n",
    "interactive, starts a python interpreter that's interactive\n",
