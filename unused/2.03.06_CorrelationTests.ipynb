    "1. Tests whether two samples have a linear relationship. \n",
    "    - The correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of the sign and strength of the linear association between two variables.\n",
    "    - It is like covariance, but divides out the standard deviations of both variables.\n",
    "    - It is unitless and always lies between -1 and 1, where 1 = perfect correlation and -1 = perfect negative correlation.\n",
    "    - The correlation coefficient will range between -1.00 (negative correlation) and +1.00 (positive correlation).\n",
    "    - Correlation is not causality. A causal relationship exists when the independent variable is the underlying contributing determinant of the dependent variable. A causal relationship may be suggested by correlation; it is not proof a causal relationship exists however.\n",
    "2. Assumptions\n",
    "    - Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).\n",

    "#### Covariance\n",
    "While variance measures how a single variable deviates from its mean, covariance measures how two variables vary in tandem from their means. \n",
    "- A large positive covariance means that x tends to be large when y is large, and small when y is small.  \n",
    "- A large negative covariance means that x tends to be large when y is small, and vice versa.  \n",
    "- If units are the product of the inputs' units, it can be hard to interpret (e.g. *friend-minutes-per-day...what's a \"friend-minutes-per-day?*) \n",
    "- *If each user had twice as many friends, but the same number of minutes, the covariance would be twice as large.  But in a sense the variables would be just as interrelated...it's hard to say what counts as a \"large\" covariance.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA or Principal Component Analysis is an application of correlation analysis. Do we use a correlation matrix or a covariance matrix? Use the covariance matrix when the variable are on similar scales and the correlation matrix when the scales of the variables differ.\n",
