    "- The results of a given test are likely to degrade gracefully rather than become immediately unusable if an assumption is violated.  \n",
    "- Generally, data samples need to be representative of the domain and large enough to expose their distribution to analysis.\n",
    "- The data can sometimes be corrected to meet the assumptions, such as correcting a nearly normal distribution to be normal by removing outliers  \n",
    "\n",
    "About the tests:  \n",
    "- There may be multiple tests for a given concern, e.g. normality, and this is by design.  With statistical tests we get probabilistic answers, thus we can arrive at different answers to the same question by considering the question in different ways."
