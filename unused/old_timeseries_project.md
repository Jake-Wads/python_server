# Time Series Project

A man wearing a lab coat and a worried expression bursts into your office.

"I need help!" he says. "I mixed up the labels and have one extra!"

Before you can ask what he has an extra of, he throws a USB thumb drive in your
direction. As you wonder who still uses thumb drives, the man in the lab coat
rushes back out the door.

"Oh, and I need to know what the missing next 2 weeks will look like too" he
says on his way out.

Before you can think of a question to ask, he's out of sight.

You open up the files on the drive and find [this](https://ds.codeup.com/fitbit-data.tar.gz).

Even though you just started a week ago, as a data scientist for Big Research Co
&trade;, you know several things:

- Your company is running multiple different experiments: drug trials,
  testing different fitness equipment, and some "very ethical" human
  experimentation.
- Everyone in every experiment wears a fitbit.
- No one seems to have time for smalltalk.
- Everyone on staff has a fitbit.

It's a pretty good guess that this data comes from somebody's fitbit, but you
don't know who it belongs to, it could be from someone participating in a
research experiment, or a staff member just going about their days.

## Deliverables

- A notebook containing your analysis, i.e. the work that you did to get to the
  conclusions and predictions mentioned above.

- A tidied data set. The source data is a little messy and there is some work
  that needs to be done before you can effectively work with it. Your notebook
  should include the code to go from the original source data to a data set that
  you can work with.
  
- A summarization of the data.

    What do you make of the data? What can you say say about the individual who
    was wearing this fitness tracker?

- Predictions for the missing two weeks worth of data in a separate csv file.

- The above information distilled into two slides that can be shared with a
  general audience. Include at least one visualization, and make sure that the
  visualization is clearly labeled.
