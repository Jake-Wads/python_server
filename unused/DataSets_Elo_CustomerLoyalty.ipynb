    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being hungry in an unfamiliar part of town and getting restaurant recommendations served up, based on your personal preferences, at just the right moment. The recommendation comes with an attached discount from your credit card provider for a local place around the corner!\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, Elo, one of the largest payment brands in Brazil, has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects and preferences in their customers’ lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile. This is where you come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, Kagglers will develop algorithms to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty. Your input will improve customers’ lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sqrt{\\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ŷ is the predicted loyalty score for each card_id, and y is the actual loyalty score assigned to a card_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Submission File should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "card_id, target\n",
    "C_ID_9e86007114,0\n",
    "C_ID_1c9f77086c,0.5\n",
    "C_ID_07b20e9908,0\n",
    "C_ID_63d6bac69a,0\n",
    "C_ID_bbc26a86eb,0\n",
    "C_ID_f749aad790,0\n",
    "C_ID_7b5c15ff41,-0.25\n",
    "C_ID_ec6b0f2d30,0\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All data is simulated and fictitious, and is not real customer data\n",
    "\n",
    "What files do I need?\n",
    "You will need, at a minimum, the train.csv and test.csv files. These contain the card_ids that we'll be using for training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical_transactions.csv and new_merchant_transactions.csv files contain information about each card's transactions. historical_transactions.csv contains up to 3 months' worth of transactions for every card at any of the provided merchant_ids. new_merchant_transactions.csv contains the transactions at new merchants (merchant_ids that this particular card_id has not yet visited) over a period of two months.\n",
    "\n",
    "merchants.csv contains aggregate information for each merchant_id represented in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should I expect the data format to be?\n",
    "The data is formatted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "train.csv and test.csv contain card_ids and information about the card itself - the first month the card was active, etc. train.csv also contains the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "historical_transactions.csv and new_merchant_transactions.csv are designed to be joined with train.csv, test.csv, and merchants.csv. They contain information about transactions for each card, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "merchants can be joined with the transaction sets to provide additional merchant-level information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What am I predicting?\n",
    "You are predicting a loyalty score for each card_id represented in test.csv and sample_submission.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "File descriptions\n",
    "train.csv - the training set\n",
    "test.csv - the test set\n",
    "sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format - contains all card_ids you are expected to predict for.\n",
    "historical_transactions.csv - up to 3 months' worth of historical transactions for each card_id\n",
    "merchants.csv - additional information about all merchants / merchant_ids in the dataset.\n",
    "new_merchant_transactions.csv - two months' worth of data for each card_id containing ALL purchases that card_id made at merchant_ids that were not visited in the historical data.\n",
    "Data fields\n",
    "Data field descriptions are provided in Data Dictionary.xlsx."
