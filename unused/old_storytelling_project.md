# Statistical Analysis Project

It's 2:00 o'clock on a thursday at your job as a data scientist at ABC Telco.
You've just come back from lunch and are feeling pretty sleepy after a big meal
of thai food. You check your email and find the following message from the VP of
phone and internet services for ABC Telco:

> I need recommendations backed by data on how to reduce our customer attrition, 
> while not making crazy changes that will affect the rest of our business!
> To deliver these recommendations, I need you to look into what is likely to be 
> driving customers to leave. I know you are the expert, but I'd like to share with
> you some questions that first come to my mind that you may want to also consider:
>
> - Is price leading customers to churn?
> - Were those who churned paying more for the same services than those who have
>   not churned?
> - Is tenure leading to churn?
> - Is it a combination of the two?
> - What is our current attrition rate?
> - Is there a customer age (tenure) that shifts that attrition rate? For
>   example, do customers have a sharper drop off after month 24 than before?
>
> Again, what really matters to the product is how to reduce attrition. So answer
> any questions, do any analysis that needs to be done to make a solid
> recommendation on how to reduce attrition based on your findings.
>
> I have 3 minutes free tomorrow from 2:06 - 2:09. Let's chat then.

Luckily you recently acquired some data from Bill in accounting that should help
you answer these questions. You start looking at the data and notice there there
are a few discrepencies in it. You send bill an email:

> Hey Bill,
>
> Can we chat about the spreadsheet you sent me? I have a few questions about
> how we got some of these numbers.

And seconds later get a reply back:

> Hi there,
>
> Thank you for your email. I will be out of the office from thursday to monday
> and will not have access to email. Feel free to leave a message on my office
> line. I will do my best to respond promptly to your email when I return on
> monday.
>
> Best,<br />
> Bill in Accounting

Looks like you'll have to figure it out on your own.

## Instructions

Your data source for this project will be the telco_churn workbook you have used through your excel exercises. You will present your findings using Tableau.

If encounter some ambiguity and inconsistency in the data. It is your job to make a decision on how to handle this, and report any assumptions that you have made.

- You will want to measure the current attrition rate.  
- You will want to control for variables other than charges and tenure, that might also affect churn or also be related to charges and tenure, such as `phone_service`, `internet_service`, `contract_type`, in order to get accurate results of your testing and analysis.  
- You will want to analyze via charts, correlation tests and/or other statistical tests (t-test, chi-squared).  
- Create a single chart that supports your recommendation. You want to influence your audience to take your recommendation.   
- Walk through 'Create' steps from "prepare to create" through prototype, documenting each task along the way (photos of sticky notes, answers to questions, etc.)
- Walk through the 'refine' stage, starting by creating a first draft of your chart using Tableau. Save a copy of your first draft in a tab.  Then walk through 'refine' making necessary edits to improve your story.  
- prepare to present by walking the 'present' stage. 


## What you will deliver

- the excel workbook containing your analysis  
- The link to your tableau workbook
- a document containing your notes, screenshots, photos of your process working through the "good charts" method. 
- a presentation to the SLT (senior leadership team, i.e. your instructors) with recommendation(s)
- In your workbook and what you will present should be a tableau story that summarizes the most important information for the SLT to get out of your work...e.g. the chart, the recommendation, any necessary (but minimal) supplemental information.
