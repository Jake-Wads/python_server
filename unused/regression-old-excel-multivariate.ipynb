    "## Linear regression of multiple independent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models the relationship between a multiple input independent variables (explanatory, feature variables) and an output dependent continuous variable (target, response variable) using a linear model.  The model remains linear in that the output is a linear combination of the input variables.  \n",

    "> $y = c_{0} + c_{1}x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2} + c_{3}x_{3} + … + c_{n}x_{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm attempts to find the “best” choices of values for the parameters, which in a linear regression model are the coefficients, $c_{i}$, in order to make the formula as “accurate” as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm determines *'best'* by minimizing the error (Sum of Squared Error). SSE:   $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\hat{y}-y_{i})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once estimated, the parameters  (intercept and coefficients) allow the value of the dependent variable to be obtained from the values of the independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "- As the dimensionality of the feature space increases, i.e. the number of independent variables, the number of configurations can grow exponentially, and thus the number of configurations covered by an observation decreases.  This is visualized below, showing fewer observations per region as dimensionality increases.\n",
