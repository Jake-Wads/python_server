Storytelling and excel analysis examples to review

[Sean: Slides 2 & 3](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sean.oslin#!/vizhome/TelcoProjectCU8-2019/Story1?publish=yes)

- the info button for takeaway
- the color scheme carries through
- the structure/layout with amount of page each element takes up is great (title, subtitle, chart, etc)
- could add a reference line of the 27% and notation of percentage for context of those tenures that were over and under the population value

[Jackie: Slide 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jacqueline.shay#!/vizhome/JQ_Churn_1/Story1?publish=yes)

- good colors with red and gray...makes the red pop!
- keep it simple: create a single bar chart in the lower one and add a reference line of overall churn rate
- question is good in bottom, not in top...but add answer to the question!

[Kevin: Slide 2](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kevin.eliasen#!/vizhome/Codeup_Project_01/Story1)

- good large percentage number of overall churn
- make the other 2 percentages stand out in the same way
- make the font colors of the 3 percentage values match the gradient colors for churn rate
- adding revenue lost is extremely valuable and a big winner in a presentation to execs!
- This slide is very convincing and makes a powerful point without haphazardly implying any causation.
- Adding a filter to be able to remove any of the "big 4" would be valuable here for them to takeaway or for answering questions that might arise in the meeting, such as "what would it look like without the month-to-month included here?"

[Misty: Slide 3](https://public.tableau.com/profile/misty.garcia#!/vizhome/ReduceCustomerChurn/Story1?publish=yes)

- The drilling into month-to-month separately is nice.
- make the chart taller to show the differences more easily
- nice annotation
- add a take-away from that...what do you want the audience to get from that?  maybe "if we can keep them past month 2, then the prob of churn drops drastically, churn rate then matches the contract customers" (as an example)...however, you would prob want to mention that you don't know if entering into a 2 month contract would then cause the churn rate to happen at month 3, you could suggest an a/b test of that one. 

[Cari: Slide 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/cari.holmes#!/vizhome/TelcoChurn_Info/Story1)

- starting with overview and chart of what is called out in the recommendation as the primary issue.  
- Call it out clearly here so the audience knows it is where the pres is headed.
- Good titles of slides
- y-axis: "customer count" or "total customers"
- Add unit on tenure ("months")...convert to "years" (1, 1.5, 2, ....)
- would be interesting to do this chart as a "decay" of customers, where you start with a total number and lose x each month. 
- Be cognizant of screen size

[David: Last slide](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.tenorio#!/vizhome/TelcoProject/Story)

- reference line in tenure chart
- could combine the contracts with tenure into one chart
- good chart titles and changing default y-axis name
- include units for tenure

[Cris: Slide 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/cris.giovanoni#!/vizhome/Telco_Presentation/TelcoPresentationStory?publish=yes)

- good intro slide
- good labels on story pages
- good recommendation slide
- slide 2: reference line of the average
- key insight: clear recommendations with arrows (could simplify though)

[Matt: Slide 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt.santos#!/vizhome/ABCTelcoPrice/Telco)

- nice use of rectangle instead of pie/circle...easier to compare sizes in rectangular shape than circular shape
- add raw count as text to the existing chart, not on a new table
