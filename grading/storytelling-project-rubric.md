### Doing the analysis

Analysis is done using Excel

Current attrition rate calculated

Current attrition rate is calculated while controlling for variables other than charges and tenure:

- 0 times: attrition is not calculated when not controlling for any variables.

- 1 time: e.g., attrition is only calculated while controlling for `phone_service` or while controlling for both `phone_service` and `contract_type` at the same time

- 2 times: e.g., attrition is calculated twice, the first time controlling for `phone_service` and `internet_service`, the second time controlling for `phone_service`, `internet_service` and `contract_type`. 

- 3+ times: e.g. attrition is calculated 3 times, the first time controlling for `phone_service`, the second time controlling for `phone_service`, `internet_service`, and the third time controlling for  `internet_service` and `contract_type`.


Analysis is performed, in the form of visualization and/or statistical tests, for each of the 1-4 subgroups above. At a minimum, there is 1 viz or test per subgoup.

- 1 time: 

- 2 times:

- 3 times:

- 4 time:

Analysis done above has a clear conclusion stated. If the conclusion is "no conclusion", then we must see that the subgroup is explored in at least 3 different ways (any combination of different visualizations and/or statistical tests)

At least one correlation test is run.

Valid driver(s) of churn is/are discovered

### Developing the story

The student submitted a document with notes, screenshots, photos of the story development process (from our best practices lessons)  

The **story framework** is identified as option A
Questions re: the audience are answered:
- Who is your audience?  
- Have they ever seen this kind of chart before?  
- What do they already know?  
- Who else might see it and how?    

Questions re: the setting are answered:  
- What setting will it be used in?   
- How much time do I have?  
- How will it be displayed?  
- How big is the room?  

Brainstorming happened using sticky notes and raw ideas.  
Ideas were refined: grouping related topics, considering what overall structure will help pull them together in a way that will hopefully make sense to someone else, and discarding ideas that don't work.  
A visual, non-digital outline of the content is created that demonstrates what ideas/topics will sit where, in what form (text, metric, chart, ...)  
The 4 quadrants of types of viz are drawn, axes are labeled (Conceptual, Data-driven, Declarative, Exploratory), and a mark or label for each plot is placed in the appropriate quadrant.  

Talk and listen: the student identified the partner he/she talked with.  
Talk and listen: keywords and questions arising from conversation are documented.   

Sketch: the student identified the type of information  
- Quantitative or Qualitative data   
- How is it exposed: numerically, textually, geospatially, relationally   
- Can the data be measured or counted? (discrete data (counted), continuous data (measured))   
- Does order matter? (ordered data, unordered data)   
- Are you visualizing observations or statistics about the observations? (observations, statistics)   

Sketch: keywords are mapped to approaches/types of visualization to identify the chart type(s) that best convey your message

Sketch: chart(s) are sketched roughly, quickly, without scale, without details

Prototype: a prototype is created using paper and incorporating just enough data, like make the axes to scale, e.g., but not too much. 

Structure: Each visualization follows the rough structure recommended: 
- Title: 12%
- Subtitle: 8%
- Visual field: 75%
- Sourceline: 5%
- Alignment: minimize # of lines
- Stay on the page

Clarity & Simplicity: The visualization(s) is refined for clarity  
- No extraneous elements: does each element add meaning? is each element necessary, unique and rendered as simply as possible? Are minimal # of colors used? Does color have meaning?
- Color: gradient for continuous, distinct color palette for categorical or discrete; accomadate color blindness where possible. 
- Limit eye travel: Are labels and legends in close proximity? Am I using minimal alignment lines?
- All elements support the visual: Does each element highlight the idea and not the structure? Is "junk" removed?
- Remove ambiguity: Does each element have a single, unambigous purpose?
- Use conventions & metaphors where possible:  Take advantage of ideas we "intuitively" understand.
- Clarify with annotations, reference points, true scale as needed
- One form of emphasis per element
- No movement or 3D
- Learned structures and symbols are used where possible (such as: red=bad & green=good, time moves from left to right)
- Overview and summary is included   
- The main idea stands out: it is emphasized and isolated (adding visualization information that calls attention to it, reducing the number of unique attribute for all other elements.) 

Ethical
- No truncated y-axis that exaggerates change  
- No double y-axis that creates crossovers, matching curves or gaps that don't actually mean anything 
- No broken scales: they show drama where it doesn't exist.
- No other deceptive techniques
- No spurious correlations communicated  
- Population size is clearly communicated.  


- Are notes documented walking through steps in 2.2-create, with story framework of be 'Option A'
- Is there a paper prototype created and documented?
- Is a first version of the viz saved in a tab?
- Does the next version have changes made recommended in the 2.3-refine?
- Does the presentation include a single compelling visual summary (only 1 chart)?


The student's final presentation document is a Tableau Storyboard or Dashboard.  

The student submitted the public.tableau link to their storyboard



### Presenting the story


The student defined the issue clearly (e.g. attrition rate, goal for analysis)

The student demonstrated the issue of churn through a visualization

The student made a clear recommendation and supported it through a visualization that clearly demonstrated the the key driver(s) of churn.  

The student showed through a visualization what they would expect to happen after implementing the recommendation. 

The student has x visualizations:
- 0: no points
- 1: 1 point
- 2: 2 points
- 3: 1 point
- 4: 0 points

- Is the presentations recomendation backed up?
- Does the presentation follow recommednations in 2.4-present?
