# Project Grading Rubric

Are we looking at the process? or just the end product?

- Does the code run without errors?
- Is it reproducible?
- Are the data manipulation steps explained well / documented?
- Is the code well structured (broken up into functions)?
- Is the code well styled (good variable names, proper indentation, no commented
  out code, etc)?
- Are the figures well labeled (descriptive axis labels, good title, etc)?
- Is the text free from grammatical / spelling errors?
