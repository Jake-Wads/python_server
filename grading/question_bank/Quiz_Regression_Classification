When i fit two different linear regression models, what is the primary difference in the two models that are returned to me? 
the parameters or coefficients. 

What is the most important hyperparameter to define in the decision tree algorithm? 

I want to build a linear regression model on features X to predict target y. 
Write a function that builds the model and makes predictions of y (y_hat). 
The function should return the fitted model as well as predictions. 

Under what conditions would you use linear regression? 

What is the primary difference between regression and a classification? 

Name 3 different evaluation metrics you could use when evaluating classification models. 

Name 3 different regression algorithms. 

Name 3 different classification algorithms. 

Why is logistic regression a regression algorithm?
Why is logistic regression a classification algorithm? 

it is always necessary to scale data when doing multiple regression. t/f

what is the primary difference between the scalers in group A vs those in group B? 
(linear vs. non-linear scalers)

given a data set: 
compute the RMSE for baseline predictions made using the mean. 

put the following actions in the order they should be performed in a data science project. 

do a brain dump of initial thoughts & hypotheses of what could be driving your target variable. 
plot distributions of individual variables to identify outliers or possible data issues. 
split into train and test data set. 
fill missing values of variable B with the mean of variable B
analyze relationships between variables
identify baseline performance metric
fit model A to train data
fit model B to train data
evaluate results on train data
select best model
evaluate results on test data



- Below is a sample of a dataset:

    | hours per day | product |
    |--------------:|:--------|
    |          3.45 |       A |
    |          2.63 |       B |
    |          4.95 |       A |
    |          1.12 |       C |

    What type of chart would you use to visualize the relationship between `hours per day` and
    `product`? What statistical test might be appropriate here, given a large enough sample? 


- Below is a sample from a dataset.

    |   hours_slept |   coffee_consumed |
    |--------------:|------------------:|
    |       5.54104 |           3.24496 |
    |       7.26644 |           3.02276 |

    |       6.14643 |           3.18676 |

    How would you visualize the relationship between cups of coffee consumed and
    hours slept? What is a good statistical test for this relationship?
