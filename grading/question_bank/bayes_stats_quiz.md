1. The clerks at the walgreens on houston street have to tell every customer to
   take the survey thats printed on their receipt. Walgreens knows that only 10%
   of customers complete the survey. If walgreens has 618 customers today, what
   is the likelihood that 70 or more people take the survey? Give your answer to
   3 decimal places.

1. What is the difference between a continuous and discrete variable? Give an
   example of each.

1. When working with probability distributions, what is the function that gives
   us the probability of a specific outcome of a discrete random variable?
   (Write out the full name of the function, not the abbreviation)

1. When working with probability distributions, what is the function that gives
   us a value at which a given percentage of value are higher than that value?

1. For each of the following distributions, give an example of a real-world
    event or process that could be modeled by the distribution.

    - Uniform
    - Poisson
    - Binomial
    - Normal

1. Which distribution best represents choosing a data science student at random
   to give a presentation?

1. Which distribution best represents the number of pots of coffee that will be
   brewed on the 6th floor at Codeup over one day if we know how many are brewed
   on average? (Assume we have an unlimited supply of coffee)

1. Which distribution best represents the number of students in a class of 20
   that will arrive on time to the classroom after a break if we know that there
   is a 90% chance a given student will arrive on time?

1. What is the difference between a null and alternative hypothesis?

1. If we have a p-value of .34, what action do we take? That is, what is the
   next step in the hypothesis testing process?

1. If we have a p-value of .003, what action do we take? That is, what is the
   next step in the hypothesis testing process?

1. Codeup wants to know if being taught in the front classroom (as opposed to
   any other classroom) has an impact on a students grades. Is this a situation
   where we could use a t-test? If so, write our the null and alternative
   hyopthesis.

1. Based on the previous question, which term best describes the scenario where
   we conclude that being in the front classroom *does* make a difference in
   grade, and it really does?

1. Based on the previous question, which term best describes the scenario where
   we conclude that being in the front classroom does *not* make a difference in
   grade, but it really does?

1. Assume the time it takes to order and eat the burger special at the Esquire
   is normally distributed with a mean of 40 mins and a standard deviation of 15
   minutes. If it takes you 5 minutes to walk to and from the Esquire, what is
   the likelihood that you can go eat there during your lunch hour and not be
   late back to class?
