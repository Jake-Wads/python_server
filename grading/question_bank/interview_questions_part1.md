what is data science
difference bw data science and ... (statistics, business analytics)
examples of data products
AI vs. ML
What is deep learning
supervised vs unsupervised, what does 'labeled' data mean, types of problems for each
What is big data
components of model development (features, target, hyperparameters, parameters, ...)
role each tool plays in data science (python/r, sql, tableau, git, spark)
steps in ds pipeline (from raw data to action)
what is an algorithm
what is API
what are methods for feature engineering (don't use that term)
what is a parameter in (linear regression, ...)
what is a hyper parameter in (linear regression, ...)
git: init/commit/clone
SQL: why databases? rdbms? primary keys/tables relating to each other/foreign
structured vs unstructured data
sql basic clauses (select, join, where, having, group by)
data science libraries: name them and use cases for each
data types (dict, tuples, list, bool, nonetype)
describe a conditional statement
when would you use a for loop? while loop? risk of loops?
structure of a basic function
what is a dataframe, series, matrix, array, 
functions for summarizing data, basic manipulation of df (drop cols, change dtype, fill nulls, drop nulls, drop rows)
using .apply
seaborn: what is it? how does it relate to matplotlib? benefits
stats: measures of central tendency, measures of spread, skew
pdf/pmf, cdf/ppf: uniform, binomial, poisson, 
t-test/chi-squared/correlation: when? why? how? assumptions?
what is a contingency table
conditional probability: compute
what is cohen's d
explain how linear regression works, when you would use it, assumptions you are making, pros/cons, what happens at each piece of model dev (create object, fit, predict)
scaling data: why? when? how? methods (uniform, standard, gaussian (exp box-cox, vs. yeo-johnson), min-max)
what is the asq-recommended ratio for splitting data into 2 samples
when should you scale? when should you split? after/before exploration? after/before imputing nulls? 
how do you evaluate regression models? what metrics? how do you use those metrics? how do you know if your model is good enough? compute sse (given small dataset)
confidence intervals
feature engineering in regression
regression alg: ridge, lasso, stepwise, uni vs. multi, 
what is in-sample vs. out-of-sample? why do you have both?
classification: use cases/example problems, data types, common algorithms
describe decision tree, hyperparameters, use-cases/pros/cons, what is meant by "pruning the decision tree"
what is an ensemble algorithm? example? (random forest) how does it arrive at its predictions? use-cases/pros/cons
logistic regression: explain why regression vs classification, compare to linear regression, demonstrate sample problem, parameters? use-cases/pros/cons
evaluating classification models: confusion matrix: draw, describe
KNN: describe, vs. k-means
curse of dimensionality
clustering: when? why? use cases, what does the data need to look like? labeled data? how could you use clusters? 
what is meant by "distance" how is it measured?
common clustering algorithms...compare and contrast (k-means, dbscan, hierarchical)
time series...isn't it just regression? why? why not? examples, challenges, how to sample the data, how to test, seasonality, resampling, 
methods for modeling time series (stats: mean, sma, holt's linear trend, arima, lstm)
anomaly detection: ways to identify anomalies (vis/stats/clustering/)

what is NLP? use cases?
