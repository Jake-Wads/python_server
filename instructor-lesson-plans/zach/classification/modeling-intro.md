modeling
========

- very little code, lessons are conceptual in nature
- we'll cover the more common algorithms for different problem types, but there
  are many more out there!
- here's how a model works, here's what's different about it vs others, here's
  how to interpret (or not!) it
- how to use the model is the same for all (most) sklearn models
