In general, this content is **not** meant to be student-facing.

The following naming conventions are used:

- `_lesson`: This is a notebook that contains a complete delivered lesson.

    These notebooks might be sparse on notes as they contain whatever was
    relevant / answers to verbal questions from the specific cohort they were
    delivered to.

- `_notes`: indicates general notes for myself.

    Usually this means there is too much detail, or the content is too
    disorganized to be a lesson.

- `_lesson_notes`: Lesson plans for specific topics.

    This contains the outline for my delivery of a specific lesson.

    Sometimes (most of the time?) what is actually delivered diverges from
    what's in the lesson plan.

- `_util`: additional python code for the lesson

    Some lessons are benefited by additional python code that might be too
    complex to go into detail on in the lesson. A seperate `.py` file holds this
    code.

- `_exercise_review_notes`: my notes/outline prepping for the exercise review

    Usually I'll put this document together and then live code the solutions
    while referring back to this document if I get lost or for what to do next.

- `_student`: a notebook meant to be shared in advance of the lesson with the
  students for them to work through during the lecture.
