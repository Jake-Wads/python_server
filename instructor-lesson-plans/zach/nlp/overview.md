## Pipeline Overview

* Wrangling: web scraping; cleaning up text data

    * **ngrams**
    * **POS Tagging**
* Modeling: how do we preprocess, i.e. numerically represent, a document?

## Tools

* Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn: as we've done in the past
* nltk: natural language toolkit
* spacy
