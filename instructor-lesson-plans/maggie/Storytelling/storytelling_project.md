# Storytelling Project: What 5 colleges should Madeline apply to? 

College applicant persona
1. She loves math...science? Meh.
2. She will complete all offered math courses in High School as a Junior, so she is excited and hopeful to be able to take a course on a college campus her senior year.
3. Loves marching band (clarinet) and all the friends she has made doing it. 
4. She hates to sweat. 
5. Competed in gymnastics through 8th grade, but gave it up for band. She is still a huge fan. 
6. She formed the "official" ultimate frisbee club at her high school along with her <now> boyfriend.
7. She thinks she wants to teach at some point in her career. 
8. She volunteers tutoring math for students from elementary on into high school. 
9. She is fully bilingual, so next year, in Spanish 6, she will get to spend a class period at an elementary school helping teach students in the Spanish immersion program (the program she went through)
10. She likes fantasy, but not so much sci-fi. 
11. She loves mysteries and puzzles.
12. She doesn't really like the process of building things...she prefers the outcome as opposed to the process on those things. 
13. She is extremely adaptable. Like, for real. 
14. She would ideally love to go to school outside of the country, like Canada, the U.K., Spain, or Italy. 
15. She knows what she likes and what she doesn't like. 
16. She is introverted, so her weekends are often spent recovering from a week of intense social interaction. 
17. She does well in school and makes good grades but doesn't kill herself over it (like her mom did :-0)...(read...no Ivy league schools or those with high suicide rates or other things that might indicate over-stress, depression, and/or unhappiness!)
18. She is one of those lucky ones who is an excellent test taker (and she realizes that, so don't get mad at her ;))...this shows in her PSAT score, so we expect her SAT score will be beneficial in her applications. 
19. She doesn't want huge class sizes...10k students is probably her limit in terms of student size. 
20. She doesn't care about greek life, but having some sort of formal way to connect with people she would enjoy is important, as she is not one to take the initiative. 
21. It is important to her to be at a school that encourages diversity in all areas and that diversity is evidenced through the students on campus. 
22. A school that requires on campus housing for at least one year is important. 
23. She is adament about these things: If she stays in the U.S., she is looking toward the Pacific coast, the northeast (North of VA), and some southwest or semi-southwest states (New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado). 
24. She wants to graduate as quickly as possible. 
25. Urban...so not college station
26. Not a religious school
