    "### Challenges\n",
    " \n",
    "- Lack of communication in process\n",
    "- Unannounced deviations / project scope creep\n",
    "- Lack of planning\n",
    "- Lack of milestones\n",
    "- Lack of testing\n",
    "- Not enough buffer time to iterate effectively\n",
    "- Insufficient early exploration\n",
    "- Rabbit holes\n",
    "- No clear conclusions from exploration / lack of tying it all together\n",
    "- Lack of documentation and commenting as you go\n",
    " \n",
    "### Keys to Success\n",
    " \n",
    "- Build slides as you go...get the information on the slides, you can edit/remove later. \n",
    "- Clearly state your questions throughout exploration and answer them\n",
    "- Planning! The more planning, the more we can accomplish. \n",
    "- Detailed readme\n",
    "- Separate working notebook to avoid merge conflicts\n",
    "- Proximity, working together in person helps (welllllll, ok, with a pandemic, more reason to up the importance of communication)\n",
    "- Getting an MVP (itâ€™s the data product deliverable, not just code that runs)\n",
    "- Defining MVP/ providing clarity on deliverables\n",
    "- Splitting up work\n",
    "- Trusting your team and taking advantage of diverse strengths\n",
    "- Properly labeled & named functions\n",
    "- Early and frequent communication\n",
    "- Be nice to your body and brain throughout the process (get good sleep)\n",
    "- Take team breaks and look out for each other. Also take breaks away from your team as needed\n",

    "## Project Management of Capstones\n",
    " \n",
    "We will pull pieces from scrum and kanban, an agile software development lifecycle methodology\n",
    " \n",
    "For background, the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) includes:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Planning\n",
    "1. Analysis\n",
    "1. Design\n",
    "1. Implementation\n",
    "1. Maintenance\n",
    " \n",
    "There are different methodologies for working through these stages. Agile and waterfall are 2 major schools of thought. Within Agile are methodologies such as scrum and kanban.\n",
    "The three ideas we will make the most use of here are the scrum or kanban board (via trello), starting with larger stories and breaking them into clearly defined tasks that can be tackled quickly, and daily standups.\n",
    "See the Agile Manifesto.\n",
    " \n",
    "### The Trello Board\n",
    " \n",
    "**Stories:** Think DS Pipeline stages, e.g. project planning, data acquisition, ...\n",
    " \n",
    "**Backlog:** Create tasks out of those stories and store them in the backlog. If a task is not getting you closer to your final goal in one way or another, then it shouldn't be a task.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Next up:** Each morning, pull the next priority tasks into this column which will be what you will pull from when you are ready for a new task.\n",
    " \n",
    "If it's not a task in trello, you don't need to be working on it.\n",
    "If you need to be working on it, it needs to be a task in trello.\n",
    " \n",
    "**In progress:** What you are currently working on. If you are working on something, it should be in your name and should be in the \"in progress\" column. Given that we are humans and are incapable of multitasking, you should not have 2 cards with your name on them \"in progress\" simultaneously. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Ready for testing:** When you finish a task, update the card by moving it here before moving on. When you see a card in ready for testing on a task that you did not work on, pick it up, move it to testing, and test or review as appropriate. When you have confirmed it passes, move to done. If it is not done or something needs to be corrected, put it back in \"next up\" with notes of what needs correcting. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Done:** a task is done when it has been completed and confirmed. If further questions develop out of the task, a new task should be created. Do not continue using the same card if new questions arise! If you continue updating the same card, you will get lost down holes and feel like you never accomplish anything and that can be very discouraging, among other reasons.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Daily standups (no more than 15 mins)\n",
    " \n",
    "1. What did you work on since the last standup? \n",
    "2. What are you planning on working on next / working on now? \n",
    "3. What are your blockers (technical, personal, etc)?  \n",
    " \n",
    "We don't solve problems during the standup but we identify problems and will schedule time to solve.\n",
    "Before each standup, ensure trello board is updated, meaning all cards are in the correct columns and all known tasks have been converted to trello cards.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Other communication:\n",
    " \n",
    "In addition to daily standups w/ instructors yall should have team meetings in\n",
    "the morning, after lunch, before you leave. If this feels like too much, you can\n",
    "always stop having a meeting, but it's easier to start with more meetings cut\n",
    "back on the number of meetings than it is to go in the other direction.\n",
