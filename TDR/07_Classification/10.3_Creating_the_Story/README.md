# Creating the Story

https://ds.codeup.com/storytelling/create/

This Lesson is broken down into two main parts. The first being a mini exercise where students use cue cards to write out their whole slide deck on them. This alows them to focus more on the story and less on the technology that might hold them back. You may need to track down cure cards, pens, and pencils for the students. The next mini exercise it to digitize them using canva. When doing this stress that they DON'T need to be perfect. Refining the slides is reserved for the next lesson.
