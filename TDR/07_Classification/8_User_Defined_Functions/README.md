# User-defined Functions
<br>

User-defined functions in itself is not a lesson. It references 3 previous lessons:
    - Acquire Lesson [found here](https://ds.codeup.com/classification/acquire/)
    - Prepare Lesson [found here](https://ds.codeup.com/classification/prep/)
    - Explore Lesson [found here](https://ds.codeup.com/classification/explore/)
    
<br>

You can give students 10 minutes to read over the curriculum then take 30 minutes to ensure they understand the previous lessons.

Additionally, there are no exercises for "User-defined functions" itself.
