# Modeling
<br>

### Note:
<br>
<br>

Modeling in itself is not a lesson. This section has been split into four seperate sections:
<br>
    - Decision Tree
    <br>
    - Random Forest
    <br>
    - KNN
    <br>
    - Logistic Regression
<br>
<br>

Additionally, there are no exercises or lesson for "Modeling" itself.
<br>
<br>
There is a handout/cheatsheet that has been created for students that explains the steps of modeling (created by Maggie G) [Found here](https://github.com/gocodeup/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/TDR/7_Classification/7_Modeling/Modeling.png)
