# Storytelling


This repo is used as a guide for the storytelling module as a whole. Storytelling is a unique section in that there are no ipynb lessons or exercises. The module is delivered through a slide deck and has a series of activities to accompany it. The slide deck includes all the sections on the storytelling module so make sure to stop and do the required activities for each section. 


Storytelling has been split into four seperate sections:

- About Storytelling
- Understand What Makes a Good Story
- Creating the Story
- Refine & Present

The slides are made from pictures and content straight from the curriculum. You can use them or the curriculum itself.
