### Learning Objectives:

1. Students will understand Codeup’s working definition of Data Science

2. Students will understand which knowledge fields are drawn upon and make up a part of the practice of data science
    - Programming (Python)
    - Math (Statistics, analysis)
    - Domain knowledge

3. Students will understand that because data science is a relatively new field that draws from many different disciplines its definition not universally consistent and a data scientist could carry many different titles

4. Students will understand what a data scientist might produce as a product
    - Business and product recommendations
    - Targeted ads
    - Virtual assistance

5. Students will develop a basic understanding of different methods of giving machines instructions including
    - Algorithms
    - Machine learning 
    - Deep learning
    - Students should be able to compare and contrast these methods

6. Students will have an understanding of the general layout of the course and how they will develop their skills into full fledged data scientists

7. Students will understand what machine learning is as well as three types of machine learning classifications
    - Supervised
    - Unsupervised
    - Reinforcement

10. Students will develop a basic understanding the following 6 types of Machine Learning methods/models
    - Regression
    - Classification
    - Clustering
    - Anomaly Detection
    - Time Series
    - Each method/model should be identified by the following
        - What it predicts, including examples
        - Supervised or unsupervised

11. Students will understand Codup’s working definition of Big Data along with the 4 Vs

12. Students will understand the difference between structured and unstructured data

13. Students will understand the following machine learning vocabulary
    - Data Modeling
    - Hyperparameter
    - Parameter
    - Features
    - Feature Engineering
    - Target Variable
    - Data Visualization

14. Students will develop a basic understanding of the following programing languages including what it is, and the pro’s and cons or each
    - Python
    - R
    - Julia
    - Scala

15. Students will developed a basic understanding of the following database platforms
    - SQL
    - NoSQL
    - Graph-based

16. Students will develop a basic understanding of the following data visualization platforms
    - Tableau
    - Plot.ly
    - D3.js
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Bokeh 

17. Student will develop a basic understanding of storing, managing and processing data in a distributed environment including the following:
    - Spark
    - Hadoop
    - Storm

18. Students will develop a basic understanding of Version control systems including the following
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - GitLab

19. Students will develop a basic understanding of the Evolution and trends of Data Science
    - First chief data scientist 2015
    - Modern “Data Scientist” coined in 2018
    - Storage cost, CPU cost, and bandwidth cost is increasing data generated is increasing
    - Away from unicorn toward specialist
    - Tools are becoming more accessible
    - Analysts upskilling to data scientists
    - ML big in security for detecting threats before they happen
    - Businesses beginning to hire data science teams 
    - Smaller subsets of machine learning are making larger impacts
