### Learning Objectives:
1. Students will be able to build on top of the statistics knowledge from the khan academy prework
2. Students will understand how to use the uniform, binomial, poisson, and normal distributions to model real-world scenarios
3. Students will understand how hypothesis testing is performed
4. Students will know when to use a t-test, correlation test, and chi squared test
5. Write python code that simulates experiments in order to calculate an experimental probability
6. Students will be able to use various statistical distributions in python through scipy.stats
7. Students will be able to perform hypothesis testing using python code
