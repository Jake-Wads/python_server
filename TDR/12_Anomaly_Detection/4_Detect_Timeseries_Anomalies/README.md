## Lesson Objectives
Students will learn how to:
- Define what constitutes an anomaly under the conditions of a time-based x-axis
- Create Bollinger Bands that dynamically shift based on time oriented data in relation to a moving standard deviation
- Calculate exponential moving averages by which to compare Bollinger Band fencing
