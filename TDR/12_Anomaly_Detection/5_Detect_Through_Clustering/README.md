## Lesson Objectives
Students will learn how to:
- Create DBScan Clustering models using continuous data
- Define the terms epsilon and k in the DBScan Algorithm
- Measure point density in continuous spaces by euclidean metrics
- Differentiate between euclidian and noneuclidean metrics.
- Fit a DBScan model on continuous tabular data using Pandas and SKLearn
