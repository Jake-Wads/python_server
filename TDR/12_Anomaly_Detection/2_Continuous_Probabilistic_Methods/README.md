## Lesson Objectives
Students will learn to:
 - Define measures of central tenency for continuous variables, including:
    - Z-Score for normally distributed variables
    - IQR for non-normal distributions
 - Employ Tukey's rule for defining outlier fences
 - Record questions and critical observations of data points to discern error or establish further investigation
