# Where Do We Go From Here?

>  "If you get, give. If you learn, teach." - Maya Angelou

## Reminder for 5-1-2
- 5-1-2 is about sustainability, digestibility, and momentum for habits (to stay hot)
- The 5-1-2 is all about keeping up your habits of working every day and learning every day
    - 5 hours a day doing data science. This could be any part of the pipeline. This is an active activity. 
    - 1 hour a day looking for openings, applying for opportunities, writing cover letters, etc...
    - 2 hours a day learning something new. Prefer active learning over passive learning.

## Hone Your Craft
- The best way to hone your craft is to **build stuff that excites you** and **have fun**. 
- New data science projects are exponentially more effective than doing the curriculum over again.
- Working on things that are interesting to you is motivating

## Work With a Swim Buddy
- Work with others. Seek out opportunities to collaborate and keep building stuff!
- Make accountability partners. **Find a swim-buddy and work on things together.**
- The only thing better than a swim buddy is a team. 

## Be Your Own Publicity Agent by Publishing Your Work. 
- Publish **all** of your projects on GitHub and add them to LinkedIn under Accomplishments/Projects section.
- Write technical blog posts to establish and communicate your expertise
- The only time to keep projects off of GitHub is when someone pays you to do so!

## Proper Care and Feeding of Your Network
- Connect
    - Actively seek mentoring relationships. 
    - Talk to strangers, strategically. Talk shop. Share about your projects. 
    - Talk about what you're working on LinedIn
- Give
    - Seek to mentor others.
    - Sign up to give lunch & learn talks.
    - Sign up to give talks and presentations. This establishes your expertise.
    - Find events like SOHacks or similar civic hackathons
    - Offer to mentor Coding Office hours for incoming students
- Ask/Get
    - If you only tell folks once, most business connections won't automatically remember that you're a data scientist . 
    - It's your job to remind folks what you do.
    - Seek mentors 
    - Remind people what you do and what opportunities you're seeking.
    - Literally tell people that you are practicing data scientist, all the time. 
    - Literally ask people for introductions, referrals, and opportunities

## Consistency Beats Intensity
- Practicing the violin in a focused 45 minutes a day beats practicing all day Sunday.
- Starting small beats overcomplicating your plan and then avoiding anything.
- Over time, practice beats talent.
- Start simply so that you may simply start.
- Working through 7 chapters in one technical book beats working through the 1st chapter in 7 different technical books.

## Be intentional if you work for other kinds of compensation
- If you volunteer, do it for the warm fuzzy feelings and leverage the experience/connections as much as possible.
- If you compete in a hackathon, do it for the experience, prizes, or civic good. 
- If you get an offer to work for equity, demand to see the vesting schedule or assume it's vaporware.

## Do Competitions
- Kaggle competitions

## Mathy Video Series or Podcasts
- 3blue1brown on Youtube
- JoyOfMathematics on Youtube
- Data Skeptic

## Other Resources
- Get your digital library card for https://bexarbibliotech.org/ and you'll get access to all of Lynda and TeamTreehouse

## How to Read a Technical Book
- Identify a technical book that's not a piece of reference material.
- Make a repository for your notes and take copious notes. Commit and push them.
- When a book introduces a technique on a dataset, work through it yourself before checking any answersz
- When a book introduces a technique, try that technique out on another dataset that's not in the book
- If the book gives you exercises, commit and push them.
- When the book gives exercises, find ways to make up your own exercises that are similar, and commit and push.
