In general, ask pointed, specific questions.

The following statements are **not** questions (Read: your Codeup instructors
might be forgiving here, but you absolutely should not bring these to a
supervisor / peer):

> - I don't know what to do.
> - My code isn't working.

## Before Asking a Question

0. Understand the problem

    If you go from "something isn't working" to asking a question in under 5
    minutes, you haven't spent enough time trying to understand or research the
    problem. Try stating your problem out loud in plain english to your rubber
    duck.

1. Research

    That is, google it! Try out possible solutions you find online.

1. Before asking your question, it's generally considered good form to make sure
   the person you are asking has time.

    > - Do you have a minute to look at some Python code?
    > - Is now a good time to chat with you about a database issue?

1. Give context on what is going on. Don't assume the person you are asking
   knows exactly what you are working on!

    > I'm trying to do x, y, and z, and I'm going to show you some code to do x

1. Explain what you have already tried that did not work.

## Examples

- **Bad**: Why isn't this working?
- **Better**: Can you help me figure out why this code isn't running when I
  access a list element?
- **Good**: I'm trying to access the third element in this list with the code on
  line 83, can you help me figure out why I'm getting an `IndexError`?

---

- **Bad**: Is this code good?
- **Better**: What do you think of this function?
- **Good**: I made a function to do x and y, and it takes z as input. Would you
  do this any differently?

---

- **Bad**: Can you tell me what to do?
- **Better**: Can you provide some general guidance on how to get started?
- **Better**: Can you help me break this problem down into smaller steps?
- **Good**: I know I need to to x, and I think y and z can help me get there. Is
  this a good path to go down? Can you help explain how to use y and z to get to
  x?

---

- **Bad**: Should I use tool x?
- **Better**: Should I use x or y to accomplish task z?
- **Good**: I'm trying to do z and I'm debating between using either x or y to
  do it. I think x gives me this benefit, but y could also give me another
  benefit. What do you think of the tradeoffs between these two approaches?

---

- **Bad**: What does this do?
- **Better**: Can you help me understand this function?
- **Best**: I found some code on stack overflow when I was researching how to do x. Can you help me understand the dictionary comprehension on the third line of this function?
