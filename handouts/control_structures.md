## Types of Control Structures

- Sequence == normal "flow of control"

- Selection == Conditionals like `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Iteration == Types of loops like `for` and `while`

## The Flow of Control

- The flow of control in a Python program starts at the beginning of a script
- Each line is executed in order from top to bottom
- Flow of control follows PEMDAS and order of operations

## If Condition

Think of a single `if` as a side quest. 

If it's raining, then I'll bring an umbrella. If it's not raining, we don't do something different.

## If - Else

An if-else is a fork in the road. You can zig or zag, but there are no other options.

## If - elif - else

If-elif-else is a way of presenting multiple options
