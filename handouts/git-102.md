# More Git

- Show what has been changed since the last commit:

    ```
    git diff
    ```

- Quickly reference all the lines that have been changed since the last commit
  when writing a commit message:

    ```
    git commit -v
    ```

- Rewrite the last commit message (only do this if you haven't yet pushed)

    ```
    git commit --amend
    ```

- Add more changes to the last commit (only do this if you haven't yet pushed)

    ```
    git add .
    git commit --amend --no-edit
    ```

## Discarding Changes

**_The commands below will discard changes you've made, so be sure you want to
get rid of your work before you run these!_**

- You've made changes but haven't yet committed them

    ```
    git checkout .
    ```

    This will basically take you back in time to when the last commit was made.

- You've made changes and committed them, but want to reset back to the `master`
  branch on github

    ```
    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin/master
    ```
