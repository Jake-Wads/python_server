# Welcome to Codeup!

## Thought for the Day
> "The secret to building great products is not creating awesome features, it's to make your users awesome." - Kathy Sierra

## Mindset
- Attitude is contageous
- **Mistakes are fuel for learning**
- You learn more when you're having a good time. Have fun & enjoy the journey!
- What you get out of this program is a function of what you invest of yourself

## Expectations - know what's coming
- Expect to make *TONS* of mistakes. Again, they're fuel for learning.
- Expect to read and write a lot of code.
- Expect to learn by doing. Form hypotheses, try things, and adjust.
- Programming is a skill that requires a little study and *lots* of practice.
- Work together, search for answers, and ask for help.

## Code of Conduct

- Be Cool. Act responsibly. Behave with integrity.
- No isms (racism, sexism, ageism, ablism, etc...) Only **optimism**
- Treat each other with excellence.
- Treat the class like your job. No BS. Bring your best.

## How to Succeed as a Codeup Student

1. Practicing > Studying
1. Put on Blinders
1. Failure is Good
1. Frustration → Curiosity → Interest
1. There is no right answer
1. Try it out

---

1. Own your learning experience

    - Make sure you're **solid** on vocabulary, fundamentals, and first
      principles
    - Be honest with yourself and your comprehension. Be open with us. Ask for
      help.
    - We can explain things to you, but we can't understand it for you

2. Overcome learned helplessness

    - The **number one** learning objective: "Working with others effectively to
      find and solve problems in the face of uncertainty"
    - Expect to work with things before fully understanding all the ins and outs
    - The big take-away from Codeup is learned resourcefulness and increased
      automaticity.

3. Learn to problem solve (breaking down into small pieces)

4. Put in the reps (we can't lift the weights for you)

## What you will learn beyond the curriculum

Just about the only thing consistant with technology is its inconsistancy over
time. Every day, every hour, millions of women and men seek to improve,
redesign, and overhaul existing solutions. After 18 weeks of hard work and
dedication, you will be well-versed in modern data science best practices.
However, the details of these practices will soon become tomorrow's curiosity of
history.

1. Not only how to program, but *how to learn programming*, long after the class
   is done
2. How to form effective questions and find your own answers
3. How to debug and troubleshoot using the scientific method
4. How to think like a data scientist

## How to get the most from your Codeup experience

1. Adopt the mindset that you're learning a craft and the bare minimum won't cut
   it.
2. Read ahead in the curriculum. Read more deeply into concepts. Do extra
   research.
3. When you finish exercises, play with the code and give yourself new
   challenges.
4. Keep challenging yourself!

## Standing Homework
- Get a good night's rest. There's no substitute or energy drink that can make up for proper sleep.
- Read ahead, finish exercises, and push your work to GitHub every day.
- Practice programming problems on sites like [HackerRank.com](https://hackerrank.com)
- Work on your own projects!

## How to ask Good Questions

1. Deliberately re-read the curriculum or the problem specification. Run any
   code examples.
2. Try to state the problem to yourself in plain English. Can you explain the
   solution in English?
3. Form a hypothesis, test that hypothesis, observe the results, alter your
   approach.
4. Communicate technical clarity. "I have a syntax error on line 23. Can you
   help me identify what am I missing?" vs. "It's not working".
5. Use search engines to find similar code/problems and collaborate with your
   fellow students.
7. Ask for help during class hours. Outside of classtime, email
   datascience@codeup.com

## The Exercise Completion / Problem Solving Process

1. Set an overall goal and break the goal down into smaller steps / problems. In
   the case of curriculum exercises, this is largely done for you and the goal
   is to simply "complete the lesson exercise steps." In larger projects, this
   step will become increasingly important.

2. Understand the problem needing to be solved and how to succinctly describe
   it. For example...

    > "There is a syntax error in my `analysis.py` file on line 33."

    > "I'm not connecting to the database and my credentials appear to be
    > correct."

3. Research the problem and potential solutions further if you don't have clear context.

    - Reread exercise instructions (if applicable)
    - Refer to the curriculum
    - Check formal documentation
    - Google search and search **StackOverflow**
    - **WARNING**: often students spend too much time on this step. Limit
      research time; get CODING!

4. Create a solution hypothesis and test it like a scientist. (try to always
   have an expectation for what output you will get)

    > "I postulate that if I run my code now having changed the names of my local
    > variables, I will get an output of "test" and "loop ran" in the console."

    *Where possible*, inject places where you can print out values to better
    determine where the problem is occuring and if a potential solution solves
    the problem.

5. Keep track of various possible solutions tested. Be prepared to articulate
   them.

    > "I tried possible solution a, b, and c and got x, y, z results but I need
    > to get a q result."


### How to Get Help

1. Try to state the problem to yourself in plain English. Can you explain the solution in English?
2. Form a hypothesis, test that hypothesis, observe the results, alter your approach.
3. If that doesn't work, ask for help from `#darden-queries` or in channel
   - Communicate with technical clarity. "I have a syntax error on line 23. Can you help me identify what am I missing?" vs.  "It's not working". 
   - Use search engines to find similar code/problems and collaborate with your fellow students.
   - Ask your neighbor, then ask an instructor
4. Rinse, repeat
5. Big problems are always composed of multiple, simpler problems.
