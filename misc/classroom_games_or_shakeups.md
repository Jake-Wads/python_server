- Take 60 seconds to shout out something you know and the instructor writes the things down
- Take 60 seconds to shout out something that you're not quite 100% on, you've maybe got it, kinda got it, or don't have it at all: what is it? and the instructor writes it down
- The next n minutes are then spent reviewing the "not too sure about it" list as well as the "now we know list"
