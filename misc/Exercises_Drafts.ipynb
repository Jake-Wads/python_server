    "1. Currently the number of rows and columns in our function `hist_subplots()` is *hard coded*.  We want to avoid that where possible when the code will be repeatedly called requiring different values.  Write a function, `fig_subplots()`, that takes the a list of column names and returns a figure with a figure and axes for each of the columns.  The subplots should be distributed as evenly as possible, with no more than 4 rows and no fewer than 2 columns.  \n",
