## Communication and Contact

\marginnote{For any questions, comments, or concerns related to the classroom, please email datascience@codeup.com.}

Students will be expected to check (and respond to) their email on a regular
basis. Codeup will also communicate through Slack: a workplace chat / instant
messaging tool, and Google Classroom: an online managemenent system for grades,
assignments, announcements, and course material. Students will be expected to be
active in Slack on a regular basis.

### Slack

There are two slack channels that you will primarily interact with, `#easley`
and `#easley-queries`.

`#easley` is used for general classroom announcements. Examples of what you
might see in `#easley`:

- An announcement of when the next lecture starts
- A mid-morning reminder to take a break
- Communication with the rest of the codeup staff specific to your cohort

`#easley-queries` is a slack channel specifically for asking pointed technical
questions. Examples of what you might see in `#easley-queries`:

- A classmate's question about the exercise we are currently working on
- A classmate's question about some python code related to the current project
- Clarifying questions from instructors

\marginnote{We will cover other topics as well, but this table outlines the major areas we will focus on, and corresponds to the top-level modules in the curriculum.}

| Topic            | Description                                                                |

## Curriculum

\marginnote{
In addition to the materials provided in-class, students should plan to organize
their own notes to keep track of shared resources.
}

All student's will be given access to Codeup's data science curriculum, located
at http://ds.codeup.com. Occassionally instructors will provide paper handouts
or share code samples electronically. Supplemental material will also be shared
in Google Classroom. Lecture and exercise notes will be shared through GitHub.

\marginnote{
Students are encouraged to do their own research and utilize external resources
as well.
}

## Classroom Conduct

\marginnote{In general, you are expected to be respectful of the learning environment.}

**Do**

- Ask questions, while giving others time to talk
- Collaborate with and help out your peers
- Be curious and seek out new challenges
- Silence your cellphone
- Take short breaks when needed
- Respect your peers and their questions, everyone comes from a different
  background, and there are no bad questions

**Don't**

- Engage in off-task activities during class time (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, news
  sites, videogames, social media, etc.)
- Be out of the classroom for long periods of time
- Call and text on your cellphone
- Have a side conversation during a presentation or lecture
- Discourage others
- Sleep in class

\marginnote{We ask that you leave the classroom to perform non-classroom related activities.}

### Attendance

\marginnote{If you are not going to be present for any reason, email datascience@codeup.com to let us know.}

Class starts at 9:00 every morning. This doesn't mean you should show up at 9,
rather, you should be ready to begin at 9, meaning you should be present at
least 10 to 15 minutes prior in order to review the past day's material and
prepare for the current day.

- Arriving later than 9:00 but earlier than 9:15 counts as a tardy
- Arriving later than 9:15 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 4:45 counts as a half day absence (3:45 on Monday, 12:15 on
  Wednesday)
- Leaving after 4:45 but before 5:00 counts as an early departure (4:00 on
  Monday, 12:30 on wednesday)

## Grades

\marginnote{Your grade is made of the following components, all of which are cumulative:}

| Item        | Percentage | Description                                            |
| ----        | ---------- | -----------                                            |
| Quizzes     | 30%        | Average of quiz scores                                 |
| Exercises   | 20%        | Percentage of curriculum exercises completed by module |
| Assessments | 40%        | Performance on assessments and projects                |
| Attendance  | 10%        | Attendance percentage                                  |

- Progress reports will be delivered at the end of each grading period
- Exercise completion will be determined based on the work turned in and the
  code on your GitHub account
- No credit will be awarded if naming conventions for files are not followed or
  work is not pushed to Github by due date
- The exercises for a module are due by 9:00 am the day we start the next module
- Quizzes will be in-class, and a combination of written and multiple choice
  questions
- Assessments will be written tests, and, later in the course, data science
  projects

## How to Get Help

The primary way to get your questions answered is by asking them in the
classroom during classroom hours both during lessons and during exercise time.

Before asking for help you should use Google or other resources, ask your
classmates and finally ask your question in the `#easley-queries` slack channel.

### Study Hall Hours

While the primary time for questions and help is during classroom hours, Codeup
also offers specific study hall before and after class. This means you can
schedule time with an instructor during those hours (before or after class) for
1:1 help and guidance. To schedule a 1:1, email datascience@codeup.com. Be
prepared with a specific topic, questions, or an assignment to work through
during your 1:1.

- M-F: 8-9
- T, Th: 5-6
- W: 1:30-2:30

## Miscellaneous

### Teamwork / Collaboration

\marginnote{You should communicate in a professional manner with your teammates. If you need to miss class time during an assigned group project, for example, you should inform both instructors and also your teammates.}

Data science is not a solo activity. You will be expected to work
collaboratively with your classmates, both informally throughout the course, and
formally, in the form of pair and group projects.The first two projects will be
done solo and after that you will paired with a classmate(s). You *must* work
with a different classmate for each project.

### Standing Homework

Students are expected to work outside of classroom hours to keep up with the
course, including reading ahead in the curriculum, finishing incomplete
exercises, and practicing with external resources.

### Presentations / Code Demos

Throughout the course you will be called upon to demo, or present, your work to
the rest of the class.

\marginnote{All work and presentations must be submitted as directed prior to start of presentation. The projects will be graded on a rubric that will not be availabile ahead of time to simulate workplace practices.}

Any unexcused absence that leads to missing a presentation will cause you to
lose *all* points for the presentation.

An excused abscence that leads to missing a presentation will need to be
coordinated with instructors through datascience@codeup.com so that it can be
made up within *two days* of returning.

### Zoom

Zoom is how we will take attendance. Unless otherwise arranged with the
instructors, you will be marked absent if you are not on the classroom zoom call
by 9:00 or if you leave the classroom zoom. Students are expected to use their
real names as their names on zoom.

When on a classroom zoom call, students are expected to keep themselves muted
unless they are actively speaking. Students will be expected to keep their
webcams on during lectures or when requested by instructors. During exercise
time you may wish to keep your webcam off.
