## Curriculum

\marginnote{
In addition to the materials provided in-class, students should plan to organize
their own notes to keep track of shared resources.
}

All student's will be given access to Codeup's data science curriculum, located
at http://ds.codeup.com. Occassionally instructors will provide paper handouts
or share code samples electronically. Material will also be shared in Google
Classroom.

\marginnote{
Students are encouraged to do their own research and utilize external resources
as well.
}

## Grades

\marginnote{Your grade is made of the following components, all of which are cumulative:}

| Assessments | 40%        | Performance on assessments and projects                |
| Attendance  | 10%        | Attendance percentage                                  |

- Progress reports will be delivered every 4 weeks
- Exercise completion will be determined based on the work turned in and the
  code on your GitHub account
- No credit will be awarded if naming conventions for files are not followed or
  work is not pushed to Github by due date
- The exercises for a module are due by 9:00 am the day we start the next module
- Quizzes will be in-class, and a combination of written and multiple choice
  questions
- Assessments will be written tests, and, later in the course, data science
  projects

## Classroom Conduct

\marginnote{In general, you are expected to be respectful of the learning environment.}

**Do**

- Ask questions, while giving others time to talk
- Collaborate with and help out your peers
- Be curious and seek out new challenges
- Silence your cellphone
- Take short breaks when needed
- Respect your peers and their questions, everyone comes from a different
  background, and there are no bad questions

**Don't**

- Engage in off-task activities during class time (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, news
  sites, videogames, social media, etc.)
- Be out of the classroom for long periods of time
- Call and text on your cellphone
- Have a side conversation during a presentation or lecture
- Discourage others
- Sleep in class

\marginnote{We ask that you leave the classroom to perform non-classroom related activities.}

### Attendance

\marginnote{If you are not going to be present for any reason, email datascience@codeup.com to let us know.}

Class starts at 9:00 every morning. This doesn't mean you should show up at 9,
rather, you should be ready to begin at 9, meaning you should be present at
least 10 to 15 minutes prior in order to review the past day's material and
prepare for the current day.

- Arriving later than 9:00 but earlier than 9:15 counts as a tardy
- Arriving later than 9:15 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 4:45 counts as a half day absence (3:45 on Wednesday)
- Leaving after 4:45 but before 5:00 counts as an early departure (4:00 on
  Wednesday)

### Classroom Hours:

- Generally 9 to 5
- End early on Wednesday
- Long lunch and lunchtime speakers on Thursdays

|     | Start | Lunch        | Stop |
|-----|-------|------------  |------|
| Mon | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Tue | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Wed | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 4:00 |
| Thu | 9:00  | 12:00 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Fri | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |

## How to Get Help

The primary way to get your questions answered is by asking them in the
classroom during classroom hours both during lessons and during exercise time.

Before asking for help you should use Google or other resources, ask another
classmate and finally signal instructor with your red cup if still having
issues.

### Study Hall Hours

Codeup offers study hall hours of 8-9 and 5-6. This means you can schedule time
with an instructor during those hours (before or after class) for 1:1 help and
guidance. To schedule a 1:1, email datascience@codeup.com. Be prepared with a
specific topic, questions, or an assignment to work through during your 1:1.

## Miscellaneous

### Seating Arrangement

Seating is assigned and will be changed at the instructors' discretion,
approximately every 3 weeks. If you have preferences for where you sit in the
classroom, email datascience@codeup.com to let us know.

### Teamwork / Collaboration

\marginnote{You should communicate in a professional manner with your teammates. If you need to miss class time during an assigned group project, for example, you should inform both instructors and also your teammates.}

Data science is not a solo activity. You will be expected to work
collaboratively with your classmates, both informally throughout the course, and
formally, in the form of pair and group projects.The first two projects will be
done solo and after that you will paired with a classmate(s). You *must* work
with a different classmate for each project.

### Standing Homework

Students are expected to work outside of classroom hours to keep up with the
course, including reading ahead in the curriculum, finishing incomplete
exercises, and practicing with external resources.

### Presentations / Code Demos

Throughout the course you will be called upon to demo, or present, your work to
the rest of the class.

\marginnote{All work and presentations must be submitted as directed prior to start of presentation. The projects will be graded on a rubric that will not be availabile ahead of time to simulate workplace practices.}

Any unexcused absence that leads to missing a presentation will cause you to
lose *all* points for the presentation.

An excused abscence that leads to missing a presentation will need to be
coordinated with instructors through datascience@codeup.com so that it can be
made up within *two days* of returning.
