## Quick Facts

- native to south central china
- member of the order Carnivora, but bamboo shoots make up 99% of it's diet
- a bear, member of the family Ursidae

## Diet

Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is
primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the
giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as
carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from
consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the
microbes in its gut. Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require
bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. The giant
panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in
bamboo forests for millions of years.
