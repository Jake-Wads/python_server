#### word clouds
reflect the language within the data by emphasizing the most commonly occurring words in the context of other frequently occurring words by using font size to indicate the number of times a word occurs.     

Example from https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2012/08/evaluating-word-clouds

"Apple stores obviously really value customer service. They use surveys to collect info about each store. Each day, they create a word cloud for each store based on customer comments. What they are looking for are 5 (I'm making that number up, I don't know what the real number is) specific words - things that are considered must-haves when it comes to customer service in their stores. It's when these [5] words don't show up prominently on the word cloud for a given store that a red flag is raised and some sort of action is taken."

"With their color and structured chaos they draw people in. This can be particularly powerful when it comes to advertising. While this isn't something I would use in a more formal report, I would consider using it as a way to generate excitement or curiosity around a certain topic. I think that there are also ways to leverage their difficulty to navigate, such as a word could word search or maybe making certain words into hyperlink for hidden content."
