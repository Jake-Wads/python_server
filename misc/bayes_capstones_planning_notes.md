based on Maggie's lecture

# Bayes Capstone Project Planning

Maggie asked the class what has worked and what hasn't on their past projects
(including instructor input):

Project failures to avoid:

- Lack of communication in process
- Unannounced deviations / project creep
- Lack of planning
- Lack of milestones
- Lack of testing
- Not enough buffer time to iterate effectively
- Insufficient early exploration
- Rabbit holes
- No clear conclusions from exploration / lack of tying it all together
- Lack of documentation and commenting as you go

Project successes to include:

- Clearly state your questions throughout exploration and answer them
- Detailed readme
- Separate working notebook to avoid merge conflicts
- Proximity, working together in person helps
- Getting an MVP (itâ€™s the data product deliverable, not just code that runs)
- Defining MVP/ providing clarity on deliverables
- Splitting up work
- Trusting your team and taking advantage of diverse strengths
- Properly labeled & named functions
- Early and frequent communication
- Be nice to your body and brain throughout the process (get good sleep)
- Take team breaks and look out for each other. Also take breaks away from your
  team as needed

We will pull pieces from scrum and kanban

- Software Development Lifecycle
    1. Planning
    1. Analysis
    1. Design
    1. Implementation
    1. Maintenance
- backlog / stories / features
- make sure to define your target
- think about ds pipeline to contextualize all of your todos
- this process helps us stay on track and not go down rabbit holes
    - if it's not a todo / task, you don't need to be working on it
- sticky notes for todos / tasks / stories / features
- Examples of what might go on a sticky note:
    - Define a unit of coffee
    - Model that can predict coffee prices
    - Identify features
    - acquire data from source X
    - acquire data from source Y
    - define + document hypothesis

Daily standups (no more than 15 mins)

- What did you work on since the last standup?
- What are you planning on working on next / working on now?
- What are your blockers (technical, personal, etc)?

In addition to daily standups w/ instructors yall should have team meetings in
the morning, after lunch, before you leave. If this feels like too much, you can
always stop having a meeting, but it's easier to start with more meetings cut
back on the number of meetings than it is to go in the other direction.
