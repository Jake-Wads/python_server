# Time Series Project

For this project you will be analyzing data from a superstore. The project is
open ended and you can choose the direction you want to take it based on the
paths outlined below.

## Spec

Choose 1 stakeholders below for the direction of your project.

* CEO: Which customer segment is the best?

    If we were going to shift our company to focus more specifically on one customer segment, which one should it be?

    This question is vague and might have more than 1 answer. Consider that the "best" customer segment could mean best in terms of:

    * sales volume
    * total profit
    * % profit
    * sales growth

    In addition, has this changed over time?

* VP of Marketing: What should we market?

    We want to launch a new marketing campaign in the near future. How should we
    target with this campaign? Would you recomend targeting a specific type of
    customer, product line, or anything else?

* VP of Sales: What should our sales goals for 2018 be?

    * Are there any additional metrics should we track?

* VP of Product: Which product line should we expand?

    Is there a product category that is particularly profitable for us? Does one
    or another stand out in terms of sales volume? Does this vary by customer
    segment?

## Deliverables

* A GitHub repository containing your work. This should include:
    * A readme explaining the purpose of the repository
    * A python script or scripts that automate the data wrangling
    * A notebook or notebooks that include a summary of your data wrangling and
      exploration
* A slide deck including an executive summary slide with your recomendations and
  rationale for them. This should include at least 2 visualizations suitable for
  presentation.
* A 5 minute presentation explaining your recomendation

## Notes

* Data comes from the `superstore_db` database in the codeup cloud database.
* All of the possible questions for this project are open ended.
* There is no single correct answer to any question. What we are looking for is
  your ability to come up with a data-backed recomendation and communicate it.
* Your recomendations should be arrived at through data exploration, and
  supported by statistical testing and visualizations.
* This project is focused on analysis. While you may use some modeling
  techniques as part of your analysis, it is not required.
* Your audience for the presentation is a business executive. Make sure your
  presentation is appropriate.
