# Tips for Virtual Interviews and Meetings

To help you prepare for this type of interview/meeting, we would like to offer
some tips and tricks for virtual meetings. Please read fully and do not skim.

Below are suggestions to follow:

* Test audio and camera at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled interview. If
  sound quality isn't great, use a headset or earphones to avoid an echo.
* Elevate your laptop to avoid staring down into the camera.
* Dress professionallyâ€”and not just from the top up! Dress the part to act the
  part.
* Make sure your username is your first and last name (as shown on your resume),
  and it is properly capitalized.
* Position yourself at a table, against a plain and neutral background. Avoid
  positioning yourself by a window and make sure there is no clutter around you.
* Check the lighting in the room. Light the room from the front and not from the
  back.
* Close all other applications on your laptop and turn off notifications.
* Silence your cell phone and disable vibration.
* Have a copy of your resume on hand.
* Attach post-its around the laptop screen with prompts and questions you wish
  to ask the interviewer. Remember, I am happy to screen questions for you.
* Exclude kids, pets, etc. from the room during the duration of the interview.
* Have a pen and paper on hand.
* Have a glass of water next to you.
* Have the phone number of the interviewer in case video connection is lost.

As always, should you have any questions prior to your interview, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
