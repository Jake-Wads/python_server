All Codeup students are required to create and use a Gmail account meeting the below criteria. This email will be used in enrollment, curriculum access, job search, slack accounts, and everything else during and after the program.

All Codeup students are required to add a profile photo to their Google account.

**Why:** 
Recruiters and hiring managers will search for emails from you using your first or last name. If you are not added to their contacts, they will only find you if those names are present in your email address

Establishing a consistent professional brand is a key component of the Codeup experience. We leverage Gmail and a standard naming format for a number of reasons:

* Using Gmail gives access to the Gsuite where we can collaborate on the resume, cover letter, and other portfolio materials.
* When applying for positions, hiring managers will search in their email by name (sometimes the first name, sometimes the last name), so your email must contain both to be easily identifiable.
* Many companies use HR filters that will block applications, or flag them as spam that comes from a domain like @yahoo, @hotmail, and other non-Gmail accounts.
* Having a consistent email address for candidates help facilitate Codeup's partnerships and the presentation of potential employees.
* Many of our email accounts contain personally identifiable information (P.I.I) like birthday, graduation year, etc. We want to limit the potential bias on an application. 
* The use of a Gmail account indicates use of current modern technologies and tools.
* Hiring managers are more likely to respond to a Gmail account.


**How:**
Go to [Create Your Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)

Create a username that includes BOTH your first name and your last name. Attempt usernames in this order to find an available account
first.last@gmail.com; last.first@gmail.com; first.middleinitial.last@gmail.com; first.middle.last@gmail.com; any of the above with 2-3 numbers at the end i.e. first.last01@gmail.com

**Notes:**
Do not use more than 3 numbers in a username
The period between first.last is an aesthetic, non-functional addition. first.last and firstlast will belong to the same email account
Examples
Do not include any personally identifiable information (i.e. birth date, SSN, etc).
Inappropriate emails: topsoftwaredev, Lizylize298773; baller528; liza1987; 
Appropriate: liza.gomez; gomezliza, liza.m.gomez09

**Profile photo**: Profiles with photos are more frequently visited and favored. The catch is that if youâ€™re going to include a photo, please make it professional. (i.e., Your Codeup headshot). No selfies or zoomed-in pictures from your vacation last summer. Photos are expected on LinkedIn these days, and they increase the chance that someone will view your profile. Until you receive a professional Codeup headshot, upload a photo of just you as a headshot(making sure to avoid alcohol, parties, other people, and other distracting elements).
