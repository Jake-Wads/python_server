# Ryan's Interview Guidance

## Prepare

- Get a great night's sleep the night before the interview. The only thing better would be to get two nights of good sleep in a row before your interview.

- Hydrate beforehand and make sure you have some water handy. Have a light snack before the interview and favor a hydrating option like carrots or fruit. An apple/orange/banana is a great choice.

- Relax as much as you can.

## Permission

- It's OK to slow down and think. In fact, it's preferred because interviewers want to see/hear how you think!

- If you don't recognize a term/concept, 100% say so when asked about it.

- It's OK to repeat back the question or ask for clarification. Avoid "going fishing" for answers, though. Folks see right through that.

- It's OK to have fun w/ the interview and connect w/ people. Be professional, but there's no need to be stuffy.

## Reminders

- Be sure to breathe. Oxygen improves cognition. If you breathe normally/relaxed, you'll have a better interview!

- Expect that you'll be asked about things you haven't heard of or learned before. It's going to happen. Remember to be OK saying so if something is outside of your experience.

- An interview is how potential team-members/supervisors measure what you know that you know, what you know that you don't know, and where your blind spots are.

- In many interviews, each of your answers to a question produce follow-up questions. That's part of how the interview conversation works.

## Helpful Habits

- Repeating back the question while you breathe to give you time to think.

- Think out loud and verbalize your problem solving

- Answering questions with the STAR method - https://dardenreviews.github.io/interviewing_resources. This guides you to providing concrete examples to questions.

## Body Language

- Make regular/periodic eye contact with the camera.

- Recommend looking at the camera when the interviewer starts asking a question. Keep up the eye contact with the camera as you begin to answer the question.

- Stand up for interviews, if you can. People who speak while standing sound more confident. Standing > crunched over a laptop. You can make a standing laptop setup for super cheap. You don't need fancy furniture, you can make a standing rig for super cheap/free, see https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/06/ergonomics/ for some ideas to use items you already have.

- Smile!

- If you're on the phone, stand up and walk around!

## Practice

- Practice answering questions with the STAR method. See https://dardenreviews.github.io/interviewing_resources for an introduction and example.

- Recommend pairing with a colleague/friend to help you practice interviewing. If you're practicing with another data science colleague, take turns and be sure to provide actionable, critical feedback. Remember that feedback is a gift.
