# Professionalism 101

The sooner you understand that you will be entering the workforce with
Corporations that expect you to not only act like a professional during the
hiring process but when you join their team. In this lesson, we will go over
some best practice that we suggest you follow at your time at Codeup in order to
develop great habits. We'll be going over the following:

## Communication basics

A very basic but important part of being a Professional Developer is being able
to communicate with your team. Whether it's someone that's new or the longest
tenured member, you should consider the following:

* Check channels often (2-5 times a day)
* Reply in a timely manner
* Follow up when necessary
* Ask clarifying questions

## Digital platforms best practices

Regardless of the platform that your team uses to communicate (slack, email,
etc), it's extremely important to reply with purpose. Be mindful of the
following best practices for these two platforms. Your platforms may be
different but the best practices should be similar.

**Email**

* Check email 4-5 times a day (when you get to work, mid morning, after lunch,
  hour before leaving work, before leaving work)
* Use your full name as your display name, not a username and use a current
  professional photo. Make sure your name is capitalized appropriately--should
  not be all lowercase or uppercase.
* Read email twice before beginning to respond.
* Add a salutation/greeting i.e. "Dear, Hello, Hi," and to always use a comma
* End your body text with a call to action, request, or next step (as relevant)
  i.e. "Please let me know if there's anything I've missed from today's
  meeting".
* Sign off your email i.e. "Thanks, Best, Talk to you soon, etc"
* Build a custom email signature to include: Name, title, email, phone number
* After drafting response double check attachments, recipients, deliverables,
  deadlines.
* When responding to someone's request, ensure you give enough context to their
  questions. Avoid Yes or No responses, give more information.
* If something isn't clear, ask clarifying questions, for example (I believe you
  are asking when do I think the project will be completed, is that correct?)

**Providing notice of absence or tardiness**

* When sending an email regarding not showing up, being late, asking for help, use the following format:
	* Recipients - Team, your team lead, HR (if necessary)
	* Subject line - (Vague reason - Dates - Name) - Sick - 3/27/2020 - Christian Torres
	* Body - Give a description with a bit of context. - Hello team, Due to getting the flu from a family member over the weekend, I will not be attending work today 3/27/2020. I have communicated with my team and they are aware of the situation. I will update should things change. Thank you, Christian.

**Submitting documentation (i.e. resume, cover letter, etc)**

* Subject: [Name] [Document] [Date] i.e. Christian Torres Resume 3/27/2020
* Include in the body notice of what is being submitted and why i.e. "I am attaching my resume."

**Coordinating a meeting**

* Include a clear subject line i.e. "Scheduling a 1:1 on 3/27"
* Address the recipient i.e. "Hi Christian,"
* Propose 2 or 3 specific times and topic i.e. "Are you available on Monday,
  3/30 at 11 AM, 1 PM, or 5 PM to discuss last weeks' Javascript exercise?
  Please let me know if another time will work better for you."
* Sign your email i.e. "Thanks, Dimitri"

**Slack**

At Codeup, we use Slack but your employer may use something similar where the following best practices would still apply:

* Install the software on all devices you will be expected to be reached at i.e.
  mobile phone, work computer.
* Enable push notifications on all private messages and mentions of your name.
* Use your First and Last name as your display name, no username.
* Use the same headshot that you are using for other platforms like email.
* Keep the native app open on our devices during work hours.
* Reply in a timely fashion.

**Providing feedback**

Whether you're at Codeup or at a permanent employer, providing feedback is the
best way to ensure that you're getting the experience that you're looking for.
When asked, provide constructive feedback with possible solutions.

Dont - "Hi, there was too much work this week."

Do - "Hello, Based on the tasks and what we estimate them taking to complete, I
believe that our workload was more than a single developer can accomplish. Would
it be possible to meet before the week starts to discuss what can be
accomplished in the desired timeline? Thank you for allowing me to provide
input."

**Asking for assistance**

Asking for help can be the easiest way to become a better developer. While your
instructors are here to support you 100% of their time, your managers may only
have 15% of their time to support you so knowing how to ask for help will be
crucial to your growth. Developing the following habits while at Codeup will
helpful get targeted assistance and keeping your team as efficient as possible

* Don't immediately ask for help when you run into a problem, try alternative
  methods to find a solution.
* Use your resources to find a solution i.e. curriculum, stackoverflow, google,
  documentation.
* Ask a colleague with your level of experience.
* When time to ask an instructor/manager try to follow this structure: "I am
  trying to get my code to do A,B,C I have tried tried X,Y,Z and looked at our
  documentation but haven't found a solution. What do you recommend I do next?"
* When you find the solution, find a way to document it to ensure that you
  minimize the times you run into the same problem.

**Escalating a concern**

There may be times when you are presented with a work-related issue or concern
in your place of employment or here at Codeup. The most professional solution is
to bring the concern to the individual it applies with (should you be
comfortable doing so) and to follow the proper chain of command. You should
steer clear of “jumping over heads” and escalating the issue to a senior level
member or C-suite individual. HR is always a resource for you if you feel your
concern is not being addressed.

**Presence and attentiveness**

You may be in a class environment but it's extremely important for your
profession growth to act like a profession here to make sure that it translates
into your career. Consider the following:

* Be on time, if you can not be on time, let your instructors/manager/team know.
* Present yourself the way you would like to be considered. Placement will
  interpret your actions as to what to expect when you're in the field so we
  will consider that in your placement journey.
* When partners are invited to Codeup, show up, be aware, ask questions, be
  memorable.
* Conduct yourself in a professional manner.

**Deliverables**

Placement collateral is how you're going to represent yourself as a developer.
While we will help you along the way, the burden is on you to make sure you have
the collateral needed. Placement will grade you based on the following:

* Attention to detail
* Meeting deadlines
* Applying feedback
* Communication

**Proactiveness**

Finally, it is not enough to just to the minimum, companies are looking for more
than just "getting through Codeup". Here are a few things to consider:

* Build your own projects after you completed the Codeup projects.
* Learn platforms/languages that you're passionate about not just what companies
  are looking for.
* Talk code - don't just code, learn to speak on how and why code works.
* Get involved in your community.

Keeping these topics at the forefront will not only help you get the outcome
that you're looking for but help you keep it long term.
