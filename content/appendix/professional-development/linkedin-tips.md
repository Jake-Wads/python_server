# Tips for Engaging on LinkedIn

Engaging on LinkedIn has become increasingly important when working to increase
networking connections and searching for new job opportunities. To help you
navigate your engagement on LinkedIn, we have created the following tips to
guide you in this process.

**Make meaningful connections:**

* Connect with the Codeup network!
    * Codeup employees and alumni are aware of new connections being asked of
      them and we encourage you to send a message to those connections for which
      you do not know personally.
* Make your first goal 100 connections, then continue to grow from there.
    * This does not mean you send out blanket connection requests, but rather
      you are very intentional about each request. Send a personal note with
      your request!
    * Find commonalities: profession, interests, school, etc.
* Join LinkedIn Groups.
    * Connect with school groups and engage with alumni.
    * Organizations you’ve been associated with, past or present.
        * Volunteer groups
        * Unions
        * Meetups
        * Networking events

Notes on how to personalize your connection request:

1. ALWAYS keep it professional.
2. Write no more than 300 characters.
3. Briefly describe yourself--what is it about you they may be interested in?
    * They are an employee of Codeup and you are a Codeup student…
4. Specific reference to how you met them or their content if you don’t know
them.
    * You met at a networking event (both virtual and in-person).
    * You watched a LinkedIn Live video they led.
    * You met through a mutual friend or colleague.
5. Why do you want to connect with them?
   * They are a UI/UX designer and you are preparing to enter that field…
   * Their content is informative...
6. Close with a personal anecdote (I look forward to following your
activities/learning from you) or “Best”

**Engaging with existing connections:** This is a two-way street.

* Support your connections by lending a hand.
    * Comment on their status if they ask for a suggestion.
    * Forward a job opportunity if they’re on the search. Your generosity will
      be returned.
* Drive profile views by being active in the feed.
    * Comment on posts and make it meaningful.
    * Share articles of interest.
    * At the very least, react to comments with a “like, celebration, etc.”
* Post, Post, Post! Update and update often with meaningful content.
    * Share what you’re currently working on.
        * Add a screenshot and a note on the work.
    * Reading a book related to the work setting?
        * Share something you’ve learned or something that interested you.
    * Did one of the organizations you’re connected with post something of
      interests?
        * Share their post and add a note. Organizations share information with
          the aim of reaching a broad audience—your share will help them reach a
          larger audience and it is much appreciated!

**Use it for research**

* Prepare for interviews.
    * Explore their company page: view their activity.
    * If you know the name of the person interviewing you, view their LinkedIn
      profile.
        * If they have Premium, they’ll receive an alert if you view their
          profile and it shows initiative on your part to learn more about them.
    * Do a quick search of employees at the company.
        * Learn about the type of candidate they hire by viewing their
          activities and learning about their interests—this can allow you to
          connect on a personal level during the interview.

**JOB SEARCH!**

* Use the search bar to look for jobs
* Set up a job notification that will send you daily emails of new jobs so that
  you’re constantly in the “know”.
* Let others know you are currently open to new opportunities by updating your
  personal profile page.
* Get a referral from someone you know at the company
    * This option should present itself to you if you have a connection
    * If you have not connected with them in a while, start by asking about the
      position available and information about the company before getting to
      your ask.
    * Do not force a referral if you are not comfortable nor have a strong
      enough connection to do so.
* Make sure your “Career Interests” section of your profile is completely filled
  out.
* Follow pages of specific companies you are interested in to receive alerts of
  new opportunities.

**All in all, remember LinkedIn is a professional networking site, remain active
in your engagements, and make sure your profile is always updated.  [View
