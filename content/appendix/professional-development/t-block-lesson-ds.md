# T-Block Resume

During your time at Codeup, you will build at least 2 different types of
resumes, a “T-Block” and a “Vertical". Today, we are going to go over the
T-Block resume. The purpose of the T-Block resume is to have a 1 page, easy to
consume resume. Your resume will be made up of 5-6 different sections listed
below in order of importance:

- Professional Summary 
- Technical Skills
- Development Projects
- Professional Experience
- Military Experience (if warranted) 
- Education 

## Professional Summary

A hiring manager will spend 5-7 seconds on a resume before they move on. This is
where you get their attention. Each summary should be made up of 2-3 sentences
where you will:

- Bring out your good qualities
- Mention why you decided to become a Data Scientist
- Why does this matter to a company
- **If you get stuck trying to write your summary: ask loved ones what it is they love and respect about you. Take the characteristics they point out and infuse it into your summary.* 


## Contact Information

(not a section heading > succinctly across the top of the resume)

Include the following contact information:

- Phone number (in this format > XXX-XXX-XXXX)
- Email address
- LinkedIn Profile URL
- GitHub URL
- Personal website (once approved) 

## Technical Skills

This is where you list the Technical skills that you developed during your time
here at Codeup. It’s very important that you only list Technical Skills that you
can answer 3 levels deep in difficulty. Please list the following skills:

- Applied Statistics: Hypothesis Testing, scipy
- SQL: MySQL
- Python: Anaconda, numpy, pandas, jupyter notebooks
- Visualization and Storytelling: matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Time
  Series Analysis, and Anomaly Detection
- Natural Language Processing: nltk 

*If you’ve developed any additional skills but you’re not comfortable with an
answer 3 levels deep in difficulty, you may add a section called “Exposure to”
and list those skills there.*

## Projects

It’s important to not only have technical knowledge but also technical projects.
During your time at Codeup, you will build 4-5 projects that you will be listed
here. IF you have the additional time to create your own projects, you are
encouraged to add them instead of some of the earlier projects. The format of
the descriptions should be:

- Give a summary of what the project was about.
- What your role was and what languages were used to create the project.
- List the projects in order, starting with the most recent.

## Professional Experience

While you may or may not have any technical background, we still want to feature
your professional background and those skills that you had that transferred over
to making you a better Data Scientist. Give a Summary of your responsibilities,
ideally those relevant to the job you're looking for. See example of resumes for
proper format. 

## Military Experience (if applicable)

List your Military background as far as what Branch, years served and duties.
Please include any active or past clearance. 

## Education

For Codeup, add the following: “**Fully-immersive, project-based career
accelerator focused on the full data science pipeline while working with real,
messy data to deliver actionable insights to diverse stakeholders.**”

*This is a great place to list any further education that you have, not
including a high school diploma. This doesn’t have to be restricted to technical
degrees.*
