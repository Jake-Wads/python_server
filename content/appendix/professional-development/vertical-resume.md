# Vertical Resume

* Keep it simple: No decorative lines, icons, or unnecessary dashes or
  separators.
* Name, Data Scientist, Summary, and Technical Skills must remain in the top
  section of the first page. You may choose which sections to highlight on the
  first page, etc.
* Feel free to elaborate a bit more, but do not get carried away. You always
  have the interview to dive into detail.
* The resume doesn't have to be exactly one page or two pages. It is fine if it
  ends at any point of the second page.
