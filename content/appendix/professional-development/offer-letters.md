Verbal Offers and Offer Letters: 



**Verbal Offers** -  If you receive an offer letter, ALWAYS accept the offer! Why? The offer letter provides you detailed information about the salary and benefits regarding the role and allows you to have a better understanding of the complete offer. Also, you now have the proper information to discuss the opportunity with your loved ones and the Placement team. Accepting a verbal offer does not mean you have officially agreed to any terms. Signing an official document is the last step. Offer Letters are GOLDEN!



How to respond to a verbal offer: "Yes, I would love to see an offer letter so we can discuss the opportunity further." 



**Offer Letters** - ALWAYS share an offer letter with the Placement team so we can help you with:

* Any doubts you may have.
* Setting a plan for negotiation, if needed. 
* Leveraging this opportunity with other employers seeking to hire you.
