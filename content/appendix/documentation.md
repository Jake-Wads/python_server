# Documentation

Documentation of your program is not only an effective way to add clarity and readability to your code, it is also an expectation of programmers everywhere. Whether you are providing useful, and meaningful `README.md` files, or including DocBlocks in your source code - or simply writing guide to the touch points within your API; documentation can be one of the most pressing concerns for new software developers.

## README files

A README is a file that contains general information about, and an overview of your project. This file should be in the root directory of your project, and have a `.md` file extension. When people visit your project on github, the first thing they will see is your `README` file, so it is important to include one in every project.

For your projects at codeup, A README file should contain at least the following information:

- brief (a sentence or two) overview of your project
- link to a live demo (if applicable)
- instructions on how to setup the project (i.e. What do I need to do to run
  this for myself on my laptop?)
- description of how the project is organized (i.e. a description of the
  contents of any subdirectories, etc)
- a description of your project planning, or a link to a document that contains
  this information

## Markdown

README files can be written (most commonly) in markdown. Markdown is a plaintext format that is meant to be human readable, and can be turned into html. While not suitable for building front-end html files for web applications, it is a great fit for writing technical documentation.

Here is a short example of what markdown looks like:

```markdown
# I am an first level heading
## I am an second level heading
### I am an third level heading

This is a *paragraph*. Inside this paragraph is [a link to google](https://google.com/)

- here is a
- bulleted
- list
- *this list item is italicized*
- **this list item is bold**

~~~

You can test out markdown by going to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) and creating a gist with a file extension of `.md`. When you update the file, github will render the markdown file as html.
