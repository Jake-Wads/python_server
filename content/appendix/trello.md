# Project Management with Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com)

**Requirements, aka User Stories**: What are the requirements of this project? See project spec. Usually there is not a "project spec" where you will be working, but you will create it by talking to the stakeholders and end users (those who will benefit from your work) to understand what is needed. Once you have entered the requirements in the requirements stage, you decide which requirements you will be able to complete. Your goal is to complete all the user requirements for this sprint. Where you learn to give and take is how deeply you go with each requirement. We will discuss when we get to breaking down tasks.

- As a *data science team member*, I need to understand how we can improve our zestimate. I need to see a report explaining clearly and with confidence what key drivers are related to the difference between our zestimate and the actual sales prices.

**Current Sprint**: A sprint in Agile workflow is generally about 1-2 weeks. Here we are practicing working through a 4-day sprint. The point of sprints is that at the end, you have something that is a working feature. In this case, you have a working report with information to deliver. THIS is the MVP. Once you have entered the requirements in the requirements stage, you decide which requirements you will be able to complete. Ideally, you will be able to complete the requirements, and where you will hold yourself back is on how deeply you will complete each requirement.

**On Hold**:
This can mean a lot of different things to different teams/scenarios.
In this case, we will use "On-Hold" to hold those tasks that can't be defined until you know more. In other words, completing the defining and time estimate of the task is on-hold until you have completed specific other tasks.

**In Progress**:
What task are you working on RIGHT NOW?
You should only have ONE task in progress at any given time, as you can only work on one task at a time. We are not able to multitask in that way! When you work with a team, each team member should only have one task in progress at any given time.

Each task should take between 10 min and 2 hours. If a task is estimated to take longer than 2 hours, then it should be broken down into smaller tasks.

**Test/Verify**:
For each task, I want you to document on the card as a comment, one thing that could have gone wrong in your completion of the task. e.g. I could different number of results than I should becuase of my joins. Once I added this line of code to my prepare function, I may have broken the function without realizing it. Was this the appropriate test for the question I had? Did I violate any assumptions?
You and your partner(s) (someone in your working group, doesn't have to be same person every time) will perform a little QA (quality assurance) for each other by addressing, testing, validating the tasks by focusing on the documentation of "what could have gone wrong".

When the partner has completed this, if there is nothing to fix, they will move the card to "done". If there is something to fix, the partner will return the card to "to be debugged".

**Questions for others**:
When you run into a question that you need answered, but you don't want to stop your progress, add this to the questions column, and continue working as you would until you reach a good stopping point to ask, or until someone is available. Also, you may have a question for the stakeholder about what they want.

**For next sprint/if more time**:
 This is the column that will save you from yourself! Those ideas that come up as you are working on something else, those questions that arise as a result of another discover...those go here.  You want to stay the course you are on because you know that the course you are on has been vetted and will get you to where you need to be. So, in order to not derail the existing task you're on, to not stop what you are doing and end up with a bunch of partially finished tasks, add those here, note the squirrels you encounter, the rabbit holes you cross here, so you can come back to them later when you have a fully functional MVP.
 This can also include things you want to improve upon. Maybe you want to refactor some code because you know it currently looks ugly, but it works. Documenting that here is a great idea!
 If you have time you can move one card at a time into "current sprint", work it, complete it, test it, before moving on. Whatever is left can be included in your conclusion of your notebook, where you add "if I had more time...", or "my next step is..."

 **Interesting Findings**:
 This is a great place to note just that. You can take screen shots and include them. This will help you with what should be included in your final notebook so you don't forget something cool you found! Interesting questions go in "for next time", interesting findings go here to remind you of what to call out in the end, once you are exhausted from all the data you've looked at.

 **Resources used**:
 If you found sites, resources, data sources, etc. useful, include them here. That way you can answer questions when others ask where did you hear that from. Or you can go back when you are trying to remember and look for something else.
