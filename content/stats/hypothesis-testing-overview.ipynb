    "\n",
    "According to [Scribbr.com](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/population-vs-sample/#:~:text=A%20population%20is%20the%20entire,t%20always%20refer%20to%20people.), \"A **population** is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A **sample** is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population. In research, a population doesnâ€™t always refer to people. It can mean a group containing elements of anything you want to study, such as objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a dataset that contains information about 600 statistics students: their hair and eye color and their sex. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we know is we have a sample of *some* population. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we don't know is what population it is a representative sample of. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions we may ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is this a representative sample of *all* statistics students?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ...of *all* students?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ...of statistics students in a certain region of the world? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. ...of college statistics students in the US?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ...of people in the U.S.?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ...(and on and on)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take, for example, the question of \"Is this a representative sample of people in the U.S.?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use statistical testing to determine the probability that this sample is a sample of the general U.S. population. My hypothesis is that it is not of the general U.S. population because within this group of students, I found that 36% of them have blue eyes. However, according to [heffingtons](https://heffingtons.com/interesting-facts-about-eye-color/), the estimated population proportion of blue eyes in the U.S. is 27%. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Brown Eyes: 45%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blue Eyes: 27%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hazel Eyes: 18% (Note: Hazel eyes consist of shades of brown and green.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Green Eyes: 9%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other: 1%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But is this difference significant? I.e. If I took a sample of 600 people across the U.S., what is the probability that 36% of that sample had blue eyes? I'm going to say that if the probability of that happening is < 5%, then I will conclude that this is a sample of a different population. If it is > 5%, I will conclude that the 9% difference was just by chance and this still appears to be a sample of the U.S. population as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to look at hair and eye color together and look for relationships. Possible questions could be: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Are brown eyes more likely to be associated with brown or black hair?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are green eyes more likely to be associated with blond or red hair? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we would be testing relationships, to see if two categorical variables are dependent on each other. In that case we could use something like a Chi-Square test for independence. "

    "## Null and Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing formal statistical hypothesis testing, the question being asked needs to be phrased as a **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) and an **alternative hypothesis** ($H_a$) . The null hypothesis is the \"status quo\" and usually reflects no change or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis says that there is a difference or change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - $H_0$: There is no difference between right-handed people and left-handed individual's heights.\n",
    "> - $H_a$: There is a difference between right-handed people and left-handed individual's heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - $H_0$: The amount of sleep a student gets the night before an exam makes no difference on the student's exam score.\n",
    "> - $H_a$: Less sleep the night before an exam leads to a lower exam score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of a hypothesis test will lead us to either **reject the null hypothesis** or **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. Strictly speaking, this does not tell us that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis can either be that there is a difference or that the difference is either greater or less than. This tells us whether we are setting up a **two-tailed** (for any difference) or **one-tailed** (for a specific difference) test."

By choosing a confidence interval, we set our **significance level**, $\\alpha$ (alpha) as well. $\\alpha$ is defined as 1 - our confidence level. Typical values for our confidence interval are 95%, 99% and 99.9%."

    "\n",
    "The p-value is the chance that we obtained the results we did (or would obtain more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true.\n",

    "- $H_0$: There is no difference in grade for coffee and non-coffee drinkers.\n",
    "- $H_a$: Coffee drinkers have higher grades than non-coffee drinkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we end up with a p-value of .05. This means that if it's true that there is no difference in grades, and we ran the experiment 20 times, we would expect 1 out of the 20 experiments to tell us that there is a difference in grades, purely due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our previously set confidence interval and p-value, we decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or not. If our p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis, otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
