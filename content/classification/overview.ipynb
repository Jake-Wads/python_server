    "Classification is a technique for labeling the class of an observation. This is done through the modeling of the patterns in the related data which drive the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of developing a classification model is to generalize patterns. This is done so that the category/class of new data can be identified with a high degree of certainty. Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. It can be used to predict binary classes (2 classes) or multi-classes (>2 classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will explore **supervised** (the data is labeled) machine learning related to **classification** (the target variable is categorical) using **structured** (the data can be naturally stored in rows and columns) data. We will work through the data science pipeline, as well as improving our knowledge of the python programming language."
