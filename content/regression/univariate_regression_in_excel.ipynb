    "#### Coefficient of Determination, $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared tells you how well your model fits the data by measuring the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable. However, it is not a formal test for the relationship. The F-test of overall significance is the hypothesis test for this relationship. If the overall F-test is significant, you can conclude that R-squared does not equal zero, and the correlation between the model and dependent variable is statistically significant.\n",

    "#### The F-test of overall significance \n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test indicates whether your linear regression model provides a better fit to the data than a model that contains no independent variables. \n",
    "F-tests can evaluate multiple model terms simultaneously, which allows them to compare the fits of different linear models. In contrast, t-tests can evaluate just one term at a time.\n",
    "In statistical output, you can find the overall F-test in the ANOVA table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test for overall significance has the following two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The null hypothesis** states that the model with no independent variables fits the data as well as your model. (Significance F > 0.05)   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The alternative hypothesis** says that your model fits the data better than the intercept-only model. (Significance F <= 0.05)  \n",
    "\n",
    "`F` in the ANOVA table is the F test statistic, while `Significance F` is the p-value for the F-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understanding the results\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model with no independent variables, the intercept-only model, all of the model’s predictions equal the mean of the dependent variable. Consequently, if the overall F-test is statistically significant, your model’s predictions are an improvement over using the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If less than 0.05, you're OK => conclude that your regression model fits the data better than the model with no independent variables, meaning the independent variables in your model improve the fit.   \n",
    "- If greater than 0.05, it's probably better to stop using this set of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "If none of your independent variables are statistically significant, you can expect the overall F-test to also not be statistically significant.   \n",
    "Occasionally, however, the tests can produce conflicting results. This disagreement can occur because the F-test of overall significance assesses all of the coefficients jointly whereas the t-test for each coefficient examines them individually. For example, the overall F-test can find that the coefficients are significant jointly while the t-tests can fail to find significance individually.   \n",
    "How can this happen? The F-test sums the predictive power of all independent variables and determines that it is unlikely that all of the coefficients equal zero. However, it’s possible that each variable isn’t predictive enough on its own to be statistically significant. In other words, your sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude that your model is significant, but not enough to conclude that any individual variable is significant.\n",
