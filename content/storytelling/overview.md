# Storytelling with Data

With a story, what you do will be remembered. 

What you recommend will be considered. 

What you discover will be influential. 

*"We can't make sense of statistics very well without a narrative. Our cognitive capacity shuts down in the absence of a story."* - Robyn Dawes, Psychologist specializing in human judgment

*"More parts of our brain are active when we're engaged with a narrative. Stories increase empathy, understanding and recall. Storytelling is persuasive."* - Scott Berinato, Good Charts (2016)
