# Creating a Dashboard

A [dashboard](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards.htm) is a collection of several views or charts. In Tableau, it is another tab, just like the worksheets for charts and the data tab, but specified for dashboards. When data is modified or a chart in a worksheet is modified, the dashboard is modified, and vice versa. 

Remember all we have discussed on knowing your audience and best practices in storytelling as you create your dashboards. Who is your audience, what is the purpose of the dashboard, what is the setting or what kind of device will it be viewed on, etc. 

## Lesson Goals

- Create a dashboard  
- Set default display to be tablet or phone   
- Add charts to dashboard    
- Group layout containers   
- Add text objects   
- Add interactivity through highlighting and filters

## Dashboard Display  

- [Dashboard Size](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm#dashboard-size-options): options include fixed size (default: dashboard remains the same size), range (size scales between a min and max value), and automatic (resizes to fit the window used).   

- [Dashboard Device Layouts](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_dsd_create.htm): You can make use of templates and create dashboard layouts based on the type of device the dashboard will be viewed on (phone, tablet, desktop).  

- [Accessible Dashboards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/accessibility_dashboards.htm): Tableau also has features for creating accessible dashboards that you can look into further using the hyperlink.   

- [Managing Sheets in Dashboard Display](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/environ_workbooksandsheets_sheets_hideshow.htm): When you are deploying a dashboard or a story, you will want to manage your sheets so that you product is clean and simple.

## Dashboard Objects  

To [add an object](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_create.htm#add-an-object), select an item from the bottom left corner and drag to the main area on the page. To set the options, click the object container to select it and then click the arrow in the upper corner to open the shortcut menu. 


- **Horizontal and Vertical objects** provide [layout containers](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_refine.htm#Use_a_layout_container) that let you group related objects together and fine-tune how your dashboard resizes when users interact with them. Your layout containers can be customized in ways such as [grouping containers together](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm#group-items-using-layout-containers), [evenly distributing layout containers' items](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm#evenly-distribute-a-layout-containers-items), [tiling or floating items](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm#tile-or-float-dashboard-items), and [adding padding, borders, or background colors to items](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm#add-padding-borders-and-background-colors-around-items). 

- **Text objects** can provide headers, explanations, and other information.    

- **Image objects** add to the visual flavor of a dashboard, and you can link them to specific target URLs.    

- **Web Page objects** display target pages in the context of your dashboard. Be sure to review these web security options, and be aware that some web pages don't allow themselves to be embedded—Google is one example.  

- **Blank objects** help you adjust spacing between dashboard items.  

- **Navigation objects** let your audience navigate from one dashboard to another, or to other sheets or stories. You can display text or an image to indicate the button's destination to your users, specify custom border and background colors, and provide informational tooltips.  

- **Export objects** let your audience quickly create a PDF file, PowerPoint slide, or PNG image of a dashboard. Formatting options are similar to Navigation objects.  

- **Extension objects** let you add unique features to dashboards or integrate them with applications outside Tableau ([more](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboard_extensions.htm))

## Dashboard Interactivity  

Dashboards can become interactive and more flexible through the use of filters and parameters. Also, enabling the use of highlighting allows for exploration in the dashboard. One was you can add interactivity is in upper corner of sheet, enable the Use as Filter option to use selected marks in the sheet as filters for other sheets in the dashboard. You can find other actions possible [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_dashboards.htm).

## Exercises

1. Create a Dashboard with at least three visualizations that you’ve created so far.

2. Create a text object as a header with the name “TelcoCo KPI Report”
Add [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OmmavSYhDbDxZNLvqnDMQVoN9zm09qKj/view?usp=sharing) as an object on your dashboard.

3. Determine which of your visualizations are most valuable, and remove at least one, then change the format into a phone layout.
    - How did you decide to drop one of your charts? Think about the ordination of value that each provides and describe your thought process.
