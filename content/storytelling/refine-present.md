4. Repeat until it feels natural.  
5. Practice until you no longer need to read.  

Record yourself

2. Listen for filler words.   

!!!note "Your Turn"
    You are preparing for a 5 minute presentation. Write out your script. Speak the script. Adjust the script. Speak the script. Adjust. Speak and time the script. Cut where needed. Practice with a partner. Record yourself and play back the recording. Make a note on your script where you hit the half-way point (2.5 minutes) and your time at the end of the presentation. If your presentation is longer than 5 minutes, then add a note of where you hit the 5 minute mark. Estimated Time: 3 hours.
