# Introduction to Tableau

## Tableau Products

1. [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/): 
Tableau Public is completely free to use. Data can be downloaded by anyone, so do NOT use confidential data. On the same token, it's a good place to find data to play with. In fact, all of the details behind the public visualizations you see can be accessed by anyone. If you want help getting started on a project: find something you like, open it in your Tableau instance, and modify it to make it your own.  It's a great way to learn Tableau. Limitations of Tableau Public are that your workbooks cannot be saved locally, there are fewer ways to connect data, and you are limited to 10 million rows per workbook. 
2. [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop): 
Tableau Desktop is used to create dashboards or stories, like Tableau Public. It connects to data sources directly and workbooks can be saved locally. It also is not free... or cheap. 
3. [Tableau Server](https://www.tableau.com/products/server): 
Tableau Server is used when a company wants to publish data and dashboards internally. The dashboards are created using Tableau Desktop and pushed to Tableau Server, where they are shared across the internal network. The server must be dedicated to Tableau.
4. [Tableau Cloud](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi):  
Tableau Cloud is a mix of Tableau Server and Tableau Public. Like Tableau Public, the server is hosted by Tableau. Unlike Tableau Public, your data and visualizations are private unless you specify otherwise. Like Tableau Server, you would build visualizations on Tableau Desktop and deploy them to a server.
5. [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep): 
Tableau Prep is a newer product. It is a GUI-based data wrangling application. It includes Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Prep Conductor. The builder is for creating data flows. The conductor is for sharing flows and managing them across the organization. The ideal user for this software is a data analyst with limited programming skills.
