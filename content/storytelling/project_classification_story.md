# Storytelling Project

## Scenario: 

After seeing your notebook walkthrough, your senior data scientist is adamant that you present one of your business recommendation(s) to the Telco Board.

## Objective:

Drawing on your Telco Classification analysis, choose one actionable recommendation for reducing churn. Package your recommendation into a presentation for senior level management explaining why they should act on your recommendation. Your recommendation must be an action that Telco could reasonably take to reduce churn, and must be supported by findings from your report.

## Stakeholders (Audience):

Your stakeholders are the Telco board, a group of senior level managers, who have no data science experience. Be sure to package your information in a way that can be understood by general audiences. Make sure that your charts are simple, declarative, and focus exclusively on relaying the information you want to talk about.

## Deliverables:

 1) A slide deck for your presentation
 2) A live presentation (**5 minute max**) of your slide deck delivered to an audience of senior level managers

## Slide Deck Contents:

### 1. Title Slide

- 1 slide including name, date, and descriptive title

### 2. Agenda Slide

- 1 slide briefly explaining what you will be presenting

### 3. Executive Summary Slide

- 1 slide that summarizes your presentation. Your executive summary slide must include the following: 

    *   Goal - What is the overall goal of the project for the stakeholder?
    *   Big Idea - What is the main idea that your presentation is trying to get across?
    *   Key findings - What findings from your report support your big idea?
    *   Recommendations - Given that your big idea is true, what concrete actions should the company take to achieve its goal?

### 4. Findings

- 1-2 slides that dive deeper into your key findings and support your **Big Idea**. This is where you will make a case for your **Big Idea**. Remember you need not put all of your findings in this section. Only include findings that are relevant your **Big Idea**. 

- This section should be supported by at least two visualizations.

### 5. Recommendations

- 1-2 slides that dive deeper into your recommendations. This is where you will demonstrate the value of your recommendation by showing projected results of action and inaction. Use the data in your report to make a reasonable speculation about the effect of acting on your recommendation.

- This section should be supported by at least one visualization. 

### 6. Conclusion

- 1 slide summarizing your report and leaving your audience with one major takeaway

## Scoring Criteria

Your **visualizations** will be scored using **visualization best practices**. Consider the following best practices when producing your visualizations.

*   Useful & meaningful titles that guide us to the key message
*   Axes, labels & variables are names that mean something to the audience.
*   Font size/type appropriate for setting and audience

*   Minimal extraneous elements, eye travel is limited
*   Conventions are relied upon, not fought against
*   Chart types are appropriate for the purpose and data type
*   Charts are ethical in their construction and use 

Your **presentation** will be scored using **presentation best practices**. Consider the following best practices when planning and delivering your presentation.

*   Speaker begins by introducing themselves and their project	
*   Speaker presents information in a logical, step-by-step manner, and stays on topic 
*   Speaker presents information in a way that is appropriate for their audience
*   Speaker gives a verbal conclusion highlighting one major takeaway 
*   Speaker is concise (five min max)

Your **slide formatting** will be scored using **presentation best practices**. Consider the following best practices when planning and delivering your presentation.

* Slides have a consistent theme throughout
* Conventions (i.e. red & green = christmas) are leaned into where possible

## Optional Appendix Slides

You may add a number of appendix slides after your conclusion slide. These may contain such things as further breakdowns of your data, citations, or anything else relevant to your recommendation that you care to include. These slides may be referenced during your presentation. For example, “For a further breakdown of these numbers see appendix slide a.” ***Appendix slides will not be directly presented and will not be graded.***
