    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into imports, let's discuss some terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Module** is a python file with a `.py` extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modules contain functions and variables. A module can exist in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The python standard library\n",
    "    - Community developed packages\n",
    "    - Your working directory as a file that you have created. For example, [this capstone project from the Darden cohort](https://github.com/SpotiScryers/SpotiScry) has modules named `acquire`, `prepare`, `explore`, `preprocessing`, and `model` that are imported into their jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Package** is a directory that contains modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It can also consist of other packages, or 'sub-packages'. Packages are a way to distribute one or more modules. We *install* packages in order to be able to *import* modules or libraries for use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Library** is a collection of code, data, documentation, and configuration, usually purpose built for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Libraries can be very large in scope like [numpy](https://numpy.org), a library the forms the base for most other scientific packages in python, or [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), the library we'll use for data visualization. Other libraries are smaller in scope, like [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), a library for sending HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Python Package Index**, PyPI, https://pypi.org/, is a repository of community developed Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda's **Conda** product is a package manager. It helps you find and install 3rd party packages."

    "## Import Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main sources from imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This comes with the Python language, and no special installation is needed in order to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. 3rd party packages\n",
    "\n",
    "    3rd party packages are typically installedÂ with a *package manger*, usually either `conda` or `pip`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `pip` is the package manager that comes with the python language. You can use `pip install` to install packages from [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `conda` is an alternative package management tool used by anaconda. You can use `conda install` to install packages published on through anaconda.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `conda` is generally preferred as it ensures that the versions of all installed libraries are compatible with each other, and the packages it makes available are all vetted by anaconda. While very rare, packages on pypi can by contain malicious code, as anyone can publish a package.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In general, you should research the libraries you are considering using before installing them. Visiting the project's github page, looking over the documentation, and seeing how active the community is are all good ideas.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Our own code\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can break our code into separate files and use imports to use code from one file in another python file, or in a jupyter notebook. For this course, we will store imported modules in the same directory as the file that is importing them."
