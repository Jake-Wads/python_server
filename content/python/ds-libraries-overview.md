# Data Science Libraries

All of the material we have covered thus far was about the Python language
itself, and applies regardless of what you are using Python for.

For the rest of the Python module, we will be covering how to use the most
important Python libraries for data science:

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

There are many more important Python libraries in the data science ecosystem, but we will focus on the ones above for the time being.

For most data science libraries, you'll be able to find good, up-to-date documentation and tutorials on the official project page. In addition, there are lots of blog posts and Stack Overflow questions for the most popular libraries.

!!!warning "Don't Believe Everything You Read on the Internet"
    It is important to evaluate the quality of the information when reading blog posts or Stack Overflow questions, or when watching video tutorials. Always try to look for a date that the information comes from to know how recent it is, and try to find any references to version numbers of libraries. Often times older information will not work today because of different versions of the libraries, or of Python itself.

    When in doubt, refer to the official library documentation as the authoritative source.
