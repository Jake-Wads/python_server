# Python Overview

> Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
> Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
> Simple is better than complex.<br />
> Complex is better than complicated.<br />
> Flat is better than nested.<br />
> Sparse is better than dense.<br />
> Readability counts.<br />
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br />
> Although practicality beats purity.<br />
> Errors should never pass silently.<br />
> Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br />
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />
> Now is better than never.<br />
> Although never is often better than *right* now.<br />
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br />

This module will cover the basics of the Python language and frequently used Python libraries for data science.

## Goals

- Understand how to use Python in its various forms
- Understand the different data types in Python and how to manipulate them
- Understand the logical flow of control in Python programs (conditionals, loops, and functions)
- Understand how imports work and how to use them

- Understand the purpose of, and have a basic working knowledge of the following libraries:

    - `matplotlib`
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `seaborn`
    - `sklearn`
    - `scipy`
    - `stats`
